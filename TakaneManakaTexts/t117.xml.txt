○○○○○○○○
00001
That's why I'm worried ◙about the book recommended ◙by the library committee. ◙What should I do...
00002
Manaka
00003
There's a book I've been ◙wanting to read...
00004
...▲MANAKA▲？
00005
Yes, why don't you read ◙"Red-haired Anne"？
00006
"Red-haired Anne", is ◙that a TV show or a movie？
00007
Yes. It's often on ◙display. A red-haired ◙girl from an orphanage--
00008
Yes, I know... It seems ◙that it's for elementary ◙and junior high school ◙girls...
00009
I see... that's right.
00010
(It's something ◙meaningful...)
00011
Umm, I'm not sure. Even ◙if it's "meaningful to ◙read", I'm not that ◙convinced...
00012
Oh, ▲MANAKA▲.
00013
Did you find something ◙interesting？
00014
Yes... after all, I will ◙read "Red-haired Anne".
00015
Huh？　Have you never read ◙it？
00016
In the summer of my 5th ◙grade, Mama highly ◙recommended it to me, so ◙I read it...
00017
I wasn't really sure when ◙I was asked what I ◙thought, and Mama seemed ◙disappointed so I said ◙"It's funny"--
00018
I think she knew I was ◙lying, so I said "I'm ◙sorry, I'll read the ◙book".
00019
I see... Hmm？　Huh？
00020
That's right. When I ◙heard the theme of the ◙recommended books, I ◙remembered it.
00021
Perhaps now, I can read ◙it after all this time.
00022
I get it...
00023
Alright！ Then I will do ◙my book review about that ◙book too！
00024
Emm？　Is that okay？ That ◙book is a bit girlish...
00025
I you think it's weird ◙after reading it, then ◙read another one.
00026
If you mother recommend it ◙that much, then will it ◙might be your favorite？ ◙I want to read it too, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00027
Yes, thank you. Then, ◙do you want to read it ◙together？
00028
Yes, together！
00029
○○○○○○○○
00030
Hey, ▲MANAKA▲...
00031
▲MANAKA▲！
00032
Manaka
00033
▲PLAYER▲.
00034
Let's read "Red-haired ◙Anne".
00035
I've been waiting. Do you ◙know a place where we can ◙read it？
00036
Alright, maybe a library？
00037
Okay.
00038
Then, why don't we go ◙read？
00039
Of course, I was waiting ◙because I want to read it ◙quickly.
00040
...
00041
Huh, did you forget？ ◙It's "Red-haired Anne"！
00042
I remember. Geez... ◙It's about time, right？ ◙Let's read it quickly.
00043
That's right... ◙Oh no, I have to read it ◙quickly.
00044
(That's a little overkill.)
00045
○○○○○○○○
00046
That's right, I have to ◙read "Red-haired Anne"！
00047
I wonder if she is ◙available？ I should call ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00048
Manaka
00049
What happened？
00050
Can we read together？ ◙You know "Red-haired ◙Anne".
00051
Right now？　Uh... Yes. ◙Can you come to my house？
00052
That's nice！ I'll go now！
00053
Yes. I'll brew tea while ◙I wait. Be careful, okay？
00054
That's right, I wonder if ◙that book has a sequel！
00055
Are you there ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00056
Hello.
00057
If you'd like, why we ◙don't continue reading ◙together？
00058
Of course, I was thinking ◙of inviting you. I want ◙to continue reading.
00059
That's nice！ Can I come ◙over？
00060
Go ahead. I'll wait for ◙you with English style ◙tea and muffins. Hehe.
00061
I'll go right away！ ◙I want to continue ◙reading with you...
00062
Hello. What's wrong？
00063
Do you want to continue ◙reading the book？
00064
I finally remembered.
00065
It's a bother...
00066
It's due soon, okay？ Geez...
00067
If I do my best, I'll ◙finish it in time...
00068
Then, come here, okay？ ◙Let's do our best, okay？
00069
(That's a little overkill.)
00070
Manaka
00071
You know, I just about ◙it...
00072
○○○○○○○○
00073
What？
00074
When you read the book, ◙why don't we do it ◙together？ If possible, ◙match our pace.
00075
That way, we can discuss ◙what we read and our ◙thoughts of the day... ◙Right？
00076
I see... Do you want to ◙try it？
00077
I'm glad, shall we do it ◙now？ Then, start！
00078
How far did you read ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00079
Manaka
00080
Right now...
00081
Matthew picks up Anne and ◙the two arrive at Grin ◙Gables in a carriage.
00082
Anne is cute, and her ◙imagination is amazing. ◙I hope this doesn't turns ◙sad...
00083
Marilla is about to take ◙Anne out to White Sands. ◙Trying to return Anne...
00084
I feel sorry, like if I ◙was there... ◙But Cordelia-san, she has ◙such a nice name！
00085
Anne talks to Marilla, ◙and eventually she can ◙live in Grin Gables！
00086
I was truly glad... When ◙she says "I think you ◙must have wanted me to do ◙this", I burst unto tears.
00087
Anne's original prayer ◙before going to bed, the ◙hearing the rumors of ◙Diana. I couldn't stop ◙imagining.
00088
I want to see Diana soon, ◙but I also want to see ◙Ketti Morris and Violetta.
00089
When Linde told her about ◙her hair, Anne exploded ◙and apologized.
00090
Linde became a fan of ◙Anne... It's funny. But I ◙think red hair is nice.
00091
Anne wears a flower- ◙decorated hat, goes to ◙church, and finally meets ◙the long awaited Diana.
00092
"I'm a friend's confidant" ◙...It was nice. And Diana ◙is so cute.
00093
She went on a picnic, and ◙her brooch disappeared... ◙And she found it was a ◙misunderstanding.
00094
It's weird Anne doesn't ◙forgive her, and just ◙says "Think about ice ◙cream！", I thought it was ◙weird...
00095
She hit Gilbert's head ◙with a stone plate, but ◙Diana got drunk and she ◙couldn't met him...
00096
I loved school and Diana ◙so much... And I'm ◙somewhat happy that ◙Marilla gets angry with ◙her.
00097
Anne is back in school, ◙and she gives first aid ◙to Minnie May's ◙laryngitis, and Barley ◙finally meets Diana.
00098
I think it's amazing I ◙can calmly cope with the ◙acute laryngitis of a ◙small kid... But "Anne or ◙Cordelia".
00099
At the night of the ◙debate club, she jumped ◙over Diana and aunt ◙Josephine, and was sent ◙to a haunted forest.
00100
Anyway, the girls were ◙really disciplined... ◙I think I can't stand ◙it...
00101
Anne gives Alan a painful ◙cake. And a new female ◙Sensei is coming.
00102
Anne says to Marilla, ◙"Think about how to ◙please others, not just ◙yourself", right？ Huh, ◙Mama often tells me that.
00103
Anne falls down of roof ◙in a showdown with Josie. ◙Yes, it was a program for ◙the Christmas program.
00104
Looking at Anne falling, ◙there's a point where ◙Marilla notices, right？ ◙Like a mother. I was in ◙tears...
00105
Thanks to Matthew, Anne ◙got her puff clothes, ◙made a it big at the ◙concert and created a ◙club.
00106
Matthew shopping is so ◙cute... I think I laughed ◙for a while...
00107
Anne's hair turns green. ◙And she's made a ◙Shirayuri's maiden... ◙Avonley told her romance ◙was forbidden.
00108
Hah... I wonder when ◙Anne will forgive Gilbert. ◙Oh, I said it like Diana.
00109
She spent time at Diana ◙and Miss Burley's mansion, ◙and Stacy invited her to ◙enter the School's Queen ◙class.
00110
When she returns, Anne ◙tells Marilla "the best ◙thing is to come home", ◙right？ I want to say ◙things like that.
00111
Anne and Diana spent ◙their last summer ◙vacation, and Anne passed ◙the Queen of the School ◙class！
00112
I'm proud of Anne, but I ◙understand Marilla as ◙she's grown lonelier... ◙Just like a real parent.
00113
Anne does a recitation of ◙poetry at the hotel ◙concert... And finally ◙leaves Grin Gables.
00114
I wondered if I would ◙leave home that way, and ◙cried. I cried page after ◙page. It's weird.
00115
Anne returns to Grin ◙Gables for Christmas and ◙decided to get an Avery ◙Scholarship.
00116
Matthew wants more that ◙twelve boys, right？ ◙The day Anne returned, ◙I started to cry... ◙I want him to get better.
00117
Manaka
00118
That's all for today. ◙Don't worry, we'll ◙continue slowly next time, ◙okay？
00119

00120

00286
What about you, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00287
Manaka
00288
Emm, Anne turns to ◙Marilla and--. No, I ◙shouldn't say it, it ◙seems reading won't be ◙as fun.
00289
Manaka
00290
Hah... I'm getting more ◙and more drawn... ◙I wonder why did I think ◙it was boring when I was ◙little.
00291
Manaka
00292
It was funny. Ahem... ◙No, I shouldn't laugh at ◙it.
00293
Manaka
00294
Hah. It was interesting. ◙If there was a child like ◙Anne, I would be a ◙"confidant friend"...
00295
Manaka
00296
Hah, it was fun. Marilla ◙and Matthew are so cute...
00297
Manaka
00298
Hah... it's almost over. ◙Now I'm sad after reading ◙this book.
00299
Manaka
00300
Would you rename Anne ◙with whatever nice name ◙you like？
00301
○○○○○○○○
00302
Yes, did you gave her ◙another name？
00303
Right！ Besides, you call ◙her Ann without an e, ◙right？ So, I worried and ◙looked at the title of ◙the imprint...
00304
It's "ANNE", isn't it？
00305
Did you read that far？
00306
What happened？
00307
Then is "ANNE" correct？
00308
Did you get interested？ ◙Seeing that made me happy. ◙It was as famous as Anne ◙without "e".
00309
Don't you mind？ If it ◙doesn't have an "e", won't ◙you feel sorry？
00310
That-- No, you have to ◙see it for yourself, ◙right？　Hehe！
00311
Manaka
00312
You know the story about ◙the picture of Christ ◙with children？
00313
○○○○○○○○
00314
Yes, the one about the ◙child who cannot enter ◙the circle？
00315
Yes... I could understand ◙the feeling of that girl.
00316
Emm！？ Did you met Christ？
00317
Are you a Christian, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00318
Right now you are one of ◙the child in the ring, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00319
Emm！？　No way, did you met ◙Christ！？
00320
...Huh？
00321
Are you a Christian ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00322
Me？ Not really... ◙No, it's nothing.
00323
Right now you are one of ◙the child in the ring, ◙right ▲MANAKA▲？
00324
Yes... With you.
00325
Manaka
00326
Hah...
00327
○○○○○○○○
00328
Hmm？　Is it fun？
00329
I remembered the first ◙time when Diana and Anne ◙were playing for the ◙first time. I like that.
00330
Did you play with your ◙friends in the garden ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00331
Only if you're a ◙"Confidant Friend", right？
00332
That's how girls feel, ◙right？
00333
You played with your ◙friends in the garden, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00334
Yes, but my garden isn't ◙that big. A dryad fountain ◙would be nice.
00335
Only if you're a ◙"Confidant Friend", right？
00336
Hehe, will you play ◙house with me in the ◙garden？
00337
That so！ We're going to ◙have fun playing dolls ◙with friends. It was fun.
00338
Manaka
00339
Do you remember Gilbert’s ◙"carrot", pulling on ◙Anne's hair？
00340
○○○○○○○○
00341
Ah, yes.
00342
I was done the same once. ◙But unlike Anne, I just ◙cried all the time.
00343
I wonder why boys do that. ◙Don't they know it hurts？
00344
But, crying girls are ◙funny！
00345
Did you get bullied like ◙that ▲MANAKA▲？
00346
Is that because he likes ◙you？
00347
But it's fun for girls to ◙cry！
00348
Then, you're still in ◙elementary school, right？ ◙Geez！
00349
Did you get bullied like ◙that ▲MANAKA▲？
00350
I wore glasses when I was ◙little-- no, I won't tell ◙you.
00351
Is it because the person ◙likes you？
00352
I often say that, but the ◙one who did it is really ◙disappointing. Reflect on ◙behalf of all men.
00353
Manaka
00354
Hehe...
00355
○○○○○○○○
00356
Huh？　Did you remembered ◙something funny？
00357
Yes！ Matthew is so cute ◙that I just remembered ◙him.
00358
Yeah...
00359
When it comes to Anne and ◙Marilla, who I'm against？
00360
Besides, it's actually ◙masculine, isn't it？
00361
That's right...
00362
Ah, I love that！ Hey, ◙can we do it again？ ◙Right？
00363
When it comes to Anne, ◙you go against Marilla, ◙right？
00364
That's right！ I'll always ◙be sweet to Anne. I won't ◙look like a bad father.
00365
That's right！ When Minnie ◙May gets a fever, you ◙silently prepare a ◙carriage, right？ I think ◙that's nice.
00366

Hey, there was a place ◙where Anne falls from the ◙roof and is seriously ◙injured, right？
00368
○○○○○○○○
00369
There was. Was that a ◙command game？
00370
Yes. Marilla rushes to ◙see Anne and is upset. ◙I was really sad.
00371
Anne is irreplaceable. ◙I'm sure.
00372
Tears in the eyes of the ◙demon...
00373
Anne is pretty fearless, ◙right？
00374
You'll realize that Anne ◙is irreplaceable.
00375
Yes... I think I found ◙out why Mama wanted me to ◙read this book.
00376
Or tears in the eyes of ◙the demon...
00377
Ah, that's terrible... ◙But when I read it before, ◙I thought that Marilla ◙was mean and scary.
00378
Anne is pretty fearless, ◙isn't she？
00379
Fear, huh... I'm sure ◙we've made Mama think ◙that many times.
00380
Manaka
00381
Do you think Anne will ◙ever forgive Gilbert？
00382
○○○○○○○○
00383
I don't think so, even in ◙the story they don't say.
00384
Is that right？ But... ◙Isn't Anne just like ◙Gilbert？ He's such a nice ◙boy.
00385
Do you like Anne？
00386
Isn't that a bit bad？
00387
Is that what you mean by ◙love？
00388
It's obvious, you like ◙Anne, right？
00389
You think so？ Then maybe, ◙Anne and Gilbert are...
00390
Is that so？ I don't think ◙that's-- Maybe, are you ◙jealous？ Hehe！
00391
......
00392
Puh！ I'm sorry！ But, is ◙that right？
00393
Manaka
00394
It makes sense to study ◙hard... There are times ◙you are used to it, ◙right？ I'm sure Anne feel ◙it too, right？
00395
○○○○○○○○
00396
Emm...
00397
Since I was born, I have ◙never felt like that.
00398
Your grades will improve, ◙so do your best okay？
00399
Are you the victim of ◙stuffed education？
00400
I have never felt like ◙that since I was born.
00401
I see... Okay. Well then, ◙why don't we study together？
00402
Yes. Your grades will ◙improve, so keep doing ◙your best, right？
00403
That's right！ Even if ◙it's tough, I think ◙everyone needs something ◙like that.
00404
I wonder... but, aren't ◙you excited just to learn ◙or remember something new？
00405
Manaka
00406
Hah...
00407
○○○○○○○○
00408
Another sigh？　Somehow, ◙you're doing it a lot ◙recently, don't you ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00409
Yes... I was near the end ◙of the book, and my tears ◙were going to fall... ◙I wonder what's wrong ◙with me？
00410
It's nice that you liked ◙that book so much.
00411
Yes. It's a little ◙embarrassing.. .
00412
Hey, were you not moved？ ◙That was a tearful scene, ◙right？
00413
I prefer Matthew's scene
00414
I prefer Anne's scene
00415
That makes you cry？
00416
A scene in which Matthew ◙says "I would prefer 12 ◙boys", I think that makes ◙me sadder.
00417
Me too！ I was in tears... ◙Anne was so happy.
00418
The scene where Anne says ◙"I'm very happy I came to ◙Grin Gables".
00419
Me too！ I remembered when ◙poor Anne arrived to Grin ◙Gables...
00420
Yes... Each person has ◙their own way of enjoying ◙it, right？
00421
○○○○○○○○
00422
Hah～！ I've finished ◙reading！
00423
Manaka
00424
Huh？　Are your eyes red？　◙Hehe, shall we go？ Like ◙Anne and Gilbert...
00425
Manaka
00426
Wait... ◙I'm almost there...
00427
○○○○○○○○
00428
"Red-haired Anne"... ◙And then？　Did it become ◙your favorite book ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00429
Manaka
00430
Of course... It's really ◙strange. It's completely ◙different from what I ◙read when I was a kid.
00431
I see... for example？
00432
When I was a kid, I ◙wondered what a nasty ◙person Marilla was--
00433
Anne couldn't have ◙thought that much if she ◙wasn't nice.
00434
Well, maybe in elementary ◙school.
00435
But, as I read now, I ◙found myself reflected in ◙Anne when I was a little ◙child--
00436
A lot of feelings that ◙overlap with mine are now ◙written, and--
00437
You can see how wonderful ◙Marilla was, even if she ◙was mean, and even Matthew ◙who was an old man loved ◙Anne.
00438
That's right, sure...
00439
I think I understand the ◙meaning behind Mama ◙wanting me to read this ◙book.
00440
I see... Oh？
00441
What's wrong？
00442
I feel like I can write a ◙recommendation sentence ◙with that！ Is that okay, ◙for reference？
00443
Let's see... ◙Yes. Can you write it？
00444
Alright！
00445
○○○○○○○○
00446
"Red-haired Anne"... ◙And then？　Did it become ◙your favorite book ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00447
Manaka
00448
Yes. It's the best book ◙I've read so far.
00449
That's amazing... ◙What did you like？
00450
Umm... it's hard, but for ◙example...
00451
Everyone- I love not only ◙Anne and Marilla, but also ◙Linde and Joey Pie, and I ◙feel like I know them--
00452
It feels like Grin Gables ◙is a familiar place.
00453
Yes... It feels like that.
00454
Right？ I think it's ◙because the happiness and ◙sadness of people are ◙carefully written.
00455
I'm sure Mama wanted to ◙show me her favorite Grin ◙Gables early, but...
00456
I was a kid back then, so ◙I'm sure I didn't have ◙the ability to read well, ◙and made me feel bored.
00457
I know this since I'm ◙older―― Huh？
00458
Hmm？
00459
I feel like I can write a ◙recommendation sentence ◙with this！
00460
Really？ Then, shall we ◙write it now？
00461
Let's do it！
00462
○○○○○○○○
00463
"Red-haired Anne"... ◙And then？　Did it become ◙your favorite book ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00464
Manaka
00465
Yes. I think it's the ◙best book I've read so ◙far.
00466
I'm glad about that. ◙But... Do you feel okay？
00467
I guess... Yes. I was so ◙sad since I finished ◙reading it...
00468
Are there any sequels？ ◙Do you want to read them？
00469
Not really.
00470
Maybe it's because I'm ◙getting older like in the ◙books... I feel I have to ◙leave my childhood with ◙Anne.
00471
I see...
00472
No matter how much I like ◙it, I think since I have ◙the same age as Anne, ◙will no longer read the ◙story.
00473
I feel like I understand. ◙Maybe that's the reason ◙your mother wanted you to ◙read it, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00474
I see... before I was ◙older than Anne...
00475
It sure is！
00476
(Huh？　Looks like I can ◙write something with ◙this...)
00477
顧問
00478
Oh, Red-haired Anne... ◙It's a good book, isn't ◙it？
00479
○○○○○○○○
00480
Yes. Then will you read ◙it, sensei？
00481
Of course. Taste changes ◙depending on your age... ◙Probably is a masterpiece.
00482
Manaka
00483
I really think so...
00484
And if I have a daughter ◙in the future, I'd love ◙her to read it...
00485
Should my son read it？
00486
*chuckle* Yes, it'll be ◙fine？
00487
Well, I have to make ◙arrangements... Anyway, ◙thank you！ I will read ◙the book recommendation.
00488
Hah！ It feels like I've ◙done it！ I'm glad for you ◙Red-haired Anne. Thank you ◙▲MANAKA▲'s mom.
00489
Yes. I have to tell Mama. ◙This time I can truly say ◙it was interesting.
00490
Yes... I'm glad.
00491
Wouldn't it be nice if ◙everyone checked the ◙recommendation and read ◙the book？
00492
Maybe. However, boys may ◙be reluctant...
00493
It's okay. I wrote that ◙book recommendation. ◙I think I can persuade ◙them.
00494
I hope it is...
00495
I think that there are ◙many people who, ◙regardless of gender, ◙will love to read it, ◙like me.
00496
Ah！ Then, is it possible ◙to add your favorite ◙reading for it？
00497
It's fine... But, why？
00498
Don't worry, don't worry♪
00499
(Boys who will be ◙interested in this, ◙don't increase！)
00500
顧問
00501
Oh, Red-haired Anne... ◙it's a good book, right？
00502
○○○○○○○○
00503
Emm？　Yes... that's right？
00504
Hmm？　Taste changes ◙depending on your age... ◙Do you think it's a ◙masterpiece？ You wrote ◙the book review？
00505
Manaka
00506
Yes. I really think so.
00507
Ah, did Takane read it ◙with you？
00508
Yes. With the library ◙committee.
00509
I see... Hmm？　No way, ◙this book review...
00510
Emm, that...
00511
Well, good work. I'll read ◙the book review with all ◙my heart. See, a chime.
00512
Huh... I ended up relying ◙on you until the end, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00513
That's good, but... sorry.
00514
Sorry？
00515
It's a very good book. ◙I want you to read it to ◙the end. I'm sure you'll ◙love it. Then if,――
00516
If？
00517
If we have a daughter, ◙can you recommend it to ◙her？ It's a book Mama and ◙Papa will love...
00518
Me and you... Having a ◙daughter one day. ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00519
Umm... that's in the ◙future, okay？
00520
(I'll try my best to read ◙it until the end！)
00521

00522
Hmm...
