Having fun this much... ◙You must've really taken ◙me into consideration. ◙I'm sorry. Thank you.

Manaka
00005
The date today will become ◙another lovely memory. ◙This is the privilege of ◙being your girlfriend, ◙right？
00006
Manaka
00007
If we could always enjoy ◙the days like today, I ◙think I'd fall more in ◙love with you.
00008
Manaka
00009
We've become closer on ◙our date today, right？

Manaka
00011
Today's date was nice. ◙I'm so happy. Let's do ◙this again. Please...
00012

00013
Yeah, it felt good. Next ◙time will be even better, ◙right？
00014

Today was fun, but... ◙I think we could've made ◙it better.
00018
Manaka
00019
I don't think it was that ◙bad, but... We could've ◙spent it in a better way.

Manaka
00021
Sorry, today wasn't very ◙fun, was it？ I wonder if ◙the mood wasn't right...
00022
Manaka
00023
Hey, what's up with you ◙today？ Usually, it should ◙have been fun.
00024
Manaka
00025
No offense, but... ◙I really expected more... ◙What a shame.
00026
Manaka
00027
I think it's rude but... ◙I wasn't able to enjoy ◙myself... If it's a ◙bother, you don't have to ◙force yourself.
00028
Manaka
00029
I'm sorry. To be honest, ◙it was boring. Maybe ◙something was wrong today. ◙I didn't think it would ◙turn out like this.
