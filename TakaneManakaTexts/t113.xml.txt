00038
Manaka
00039
The weather in spring is ◙warm... It feels really ◙good.
00040
Manaka
00041
It'll be more pleasant to ◙move your body on a hot ◙day like this and sweat ◙some more.
00042
Manaka
00043
Autumn is the season for ◙working hard, and do a ◙lot of things, right？
00044
Manaka
00045
Don't shut yourself in ◙your room because it's ◙cold, else you'll get ◙stuck.
00046

00052
Manaka
00053
I've been waiting for you ◙all day.
00054
Manaka
00055
The days we can't meet feel ◙like dragging a lot.
00056
Manaka
00057
I'm really glad you came ◙to see me.
00058
Manaka
00059
Are you happy to be here ◙with me？ I'm kidding.
00060
Manaka
00061
I would really like to ◙have multiple faces.
00062
Manaka
00063
I want to see you. That's ◙all I think about.
00064
Manaka
00065
I need to come and see me ◙soon... Would you say I'm ◙being selfish？
00066
Manaka
00067
Maybe you want to keep me ◙waiting. Do you want to ◙be with me a lot？
00068
Manaka
00069
When I'm with you, I have ◙a lot of fun.
00070
Manaka
00071
I wonder how many times ◙I've said in my heart ◙that I wanted to see you.
00072
Manaka
00073
I was wondering what to ◙say when you arrive.
00074
Manaka
00075
I thought you were going ◙to come sooner.
00076
Manaka
00077
Hey, did you run just to ◙come here？

00083
Did you had your New Year's ◙dream？ I had one already. ◙The contents are... Hehe, ◙I won't tell.
00084
Manaka
00085
Did you know I had my ◙first dream of the year？ ◙If you appeared in mine... ◙It's a secret.
00086
Manaka
00087
Do you want to hear about ◙my first dream？ Why don't ◙you tell me yours first？
00088
Manaka
00089
It's Valentine's Day today. ◙That's why you've been ◙fidgeting right？

Manaka
00097
On March 14th, you are the ◙person who will give ◙something to... me, right？
00098
Manaka
00099
Today is White Day！ ◙Actually, I was already ◙looking forward to it.
00100
Manaka
00101
April Fool's Day is ◙tomorrow... That was a lie.
00102
Manaka
00103
I'm sorry. When I was ◙thinking about an ◙interesting lie, it was ◙already April 1st.
00104
Manaka
00105
I'm confident that I'll ◙see through your lies, ◙okay？ I'm kidding.
00106
Manaka
00107
I've always liked ◙excursions. I'm confident ◙that I can walk as much as ◙I want.
00108
Manaka
00109
Ah！ There'll be a chorus ◙competition... Don't be ◙nervous now...
00110
Manaka
00111
Today is Tanabata. Can you ◙see the Milky Way from ◙there？ I hope you can.
00112
Manaka
00113

00121
It's nice to spend time ◙with your family, but I ◙want to spend Christmas ◙with you.
00122
Manaka
00123
Christmas Eve. Do you ◙think we'll have a White ◙Christmas this year？
00124
Manaka
00125
When you were a kid, didn't ◙you think that the night's ◙Eve was scary？
00126
Manaka
00127
Thank you very much for ◙taking care of me this ◙year. It has been a ◙wonderful year▼
00128
Manaka
00129
Whether it's good or bad, ◙you have to face the ◙results of your tests.
00130
Manaka
00131
It's almost my birthday. ◙Will you celebrate it ◙together with me？
00132
Manaka
00133
Your birthday is coming ◙soon. Are you looking ◙forward to it？ Hehe.
00134
Manaka
00135
It's almost the anniversary ◙for the day we starting ◙dating. You didn't forget ◙it, did you？
00136
Manaka
00137
It's already this time of ◙the year. There are so ◙many chocolates, that I ◙get lost.
00138
Manaka
00139
It's almost White Day, ◙isn't it？ I'll put some ◙pressure on you. Hehe.
00140
Manaka
00141
It isn't good to laugh at ◙the funny lies. But please, ◙don't tell any sad lies.
00142
Manaka
00143
You're going on a ◙excursion soon, right？ ◙I wonder if we can be ◙together that day.
00144
Manaka
00145
The chorus contest is ◙coming soon. How's your ◙abdominal-breathing going？
00146
Manaka
00147
I hope it'll sunny on ◙Tanabata. Should I ask the ◙Teru-Teru Bozu for good ◙weather？
00148
Manaka
00149
Towano Festival is coming ◙soon. Umm... Should I put ◙it in our schedule？
00150
Manaka
00151
The day for the sports ◙festival is close. It ◙might be a good idea to ◙train together.
00152
Manaka
00153
Halloween is approaching. ◙What kind of costumes ◙will we see this year？
00154
Manaka
00155
The cultural festival is ◙coming soon. We should join ◙forces to make it a good ◙festival.
00156
Manaka
00157
It will be Christmas ◙soon. I hope we can spend ◙Eve's night, just the two ◙of us...
00158
Manaka
00159
There are only a few days ◙left this year. I hope we ◙both have a happy new ◙year.
00160
Manaka
00161
The exam season is near, ◙but if we study hard some ◙days before, we won't have ◙to worry.
00162
Manaka
00163
I'm looking forward to ◙tomorrow. I wonder what ◙will happen.
00164
Manaka
00165
Tomorrow... Yes, good ◙things will happen！ ◙Never mind.
00166
Manaka
00167
I wonder it tomorrow will ◙arrive soon♪

Manaka
00177
This town is going to ◙develop more and more. ◙I want to see how we'll ◙change too.
00178
Manaka
00179
It looks like a new store ◙has opened. I wish I could ◙go with you.
00180
Manaka
00181
Which are the most popular ◙dating spots？ Why don't we ◙check them out later？
00182
Manaka
00183
Lately, you haven't sent me ◙emails... You're busy... ◙Right？
00184
Manaka
00185
You haven't sent me any ◙emails lately... I...
00186
Manaka
00187
You can send me an email. ◙Otherwise, I...
00188
Manaka
00189
We haven't seen each other ◙at all lately... Why？
00190
Manaka
00191
You haven't seen me much ◙these days... Are you ◙going to keep doing that？
00192
Manaka
00193
You don't want to see ◙me...？ I'm feeling lonely.
00194
Manaka
00195
If we are lovers, I think ◙kissing is also ◙important...
00196
Manaka
00197
We haven't been kissing ◙at all lately... I think.
00198
Manaka
00199
Hey... We haven't been ◙kissing at all.
00200
Manaka
00201
Are you okay？ You look a ◙little sick... Don't overdo ◙it, okay？
00202
Manaka
00203
