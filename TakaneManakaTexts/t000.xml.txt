Excuse me. I came to turn ◙in my club application form. ◙Is Suzuki-sensei of the ◙tennis club here？
00002
Teacher
00003
Suzuki-sensei just left. ◙Why don't you go directly ◙to the tennis club？
00004
I see. Okay then...
00005
(Hmm... They have such ◙wonderful tennis courts ◙here...)
00006
(Eh？ Classes are already ◙over, so why is no one ◙here？)
00007
(Ah, there is someone！)
00008
Um, excuse me！
00009
？？？
00010
Yes！
00011
Yes. Is there something I ◙can help you with？
00012
(Whoa... Such a pretty ◙girl...)
00013
Um, is there something...？
00014
Ah, I'm a second year, ◙▲LAST▲　▲FIRST▲. ◙I just transferred in and ◙I was thinking of joining ◙the tennis club today...
00015
Then you must be the new ◙member that Suzuki-sensei ◙mentioned...
00016
I guess that's right.
00017
Manaka
00018
I am a member of the ◙girls' tennis club and a ◙second year, ◙Takane Manaka.
00019
So we're in the same ◙grade. Nice to meet you！
00020
By the way. Does the club ◙have the day off today？ ◙It seems like you are the ◙only person here, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00021
Today's special. All the ◙boys and girls ◙went to a social ◙gathering.
00022
I see. I have the ◙application form with me, ◙but seems like no one's ◙here-- ...What！？
00023
Is it really okay that you ◙didn't join them, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00024
I... I just have something ◙to do here.
00025
？
00026
How about I take care of ◙the application form for ◙you then？ I'll pass it on ◙to the club captain.
00027
But, aren't you in the ◙middle of practicing？
00028
It's fine. Always help out ◙one another when in ◙trouble, right？
00029
(▲MANAKA▲, huh？ ◙I bet my life here will be ◙great！)
00030
○○○○○○○○
00031
Excuse me. I came to turn ◙in my club application form. ◙Is Suzuki-sensei of the ◙tennis club here？
00032
Teacher
00033
Suzuki-sensei just left. ◙Why don't you try looking ◙around the tennis courts？
00034
I see. Okay then...
00035
(Seems like no one's here. ◙Plus, it's so hot out...)
00036
？？？
00037
Hmm... All right...
00038
(A girl carrying a huge ◙kettle...？ Ah, is she the ◙manager？)
00039
Excuse me！
00040
Yes！
00041
Yes. Is there something I ◙can help you with？
00042
(Whoa... What a cute ◙manager...)
00043
Um, is there something...？
00044
Ah, I'm a second year, ◙▲LAST▲　▲FIRST▲. ◙I just transferred in and ◙I'm here to submit my club ◙application form...
00045
Then you must be the new ◙member that Suzuki-sensei ◙mentioned...
00046
I guess so. Are you the ◙tennis club's manager？
00047
Hehe...
00048
？
00049
Manaka
00050
I'm a second year in the ◙girls' tennis club, Takane ◙Manaka. I'm actually a player.
00051
Team member？ But you're ◙carrying that huge kettle ◙so I thought...
00052
This？ I just brewed some ◙tea for everyone.
00053
You had to brew tea in ◙this hot weather...？ ◙Are you being punished or ◙something？
00054
Haha, no. If I didn't brew ◙it early, it wouldn't cool ◙down in time for the club ◙practice.
00055
Well, you're right... ◙Ah, do you know where ◙Suzuki-sensei is？
00056
He said he had to go out ◙in the afternoon. Shall I ◙take your application form ◙to the club captain then？
00057
Sorry to bother you. ◙You already have to carry ◙that kettle...
00058
Always help out one ◙another when in trouble, ◙right？
00059
I'll help you carry that ◙kettle then.
00060
Hehe. Thanks. Shall we go？
00061
(▲MANAKA▲, huh？ ◙I bet my life here will be ◙great！)
00062
(There's no one around... ◙Oh, is this the clubroom？)
00063
○○○○○○○○
00064
Excuse me. I came to turn ◙in my club application form. ◙Is Suzuki-sensei of the ◙tennis club here？
00065
Teacher
00066
Suzuki-sensei just left. ◙Why don't you try looking ◙around the tennis courts？
00067
Is that so？ Okay, then.
00068
(Wow, they have such nice ◙tennis courts ...Hm？)
00069
Even though it's lunchtime, ◙there is someone cleaning ◙the courts.
00070
？？？
00071
Phew... This should do it！
00072
Excuse me！
00073
Eh？ Ah, yes！
00074
Yes. Is there something I ◙can help you with？
00075
(Wow, what a beautiful ◙girl...)
00076
Um, is there something...？
00077
Ah, um, well..
00078
I am a second year, ◙▲LAST▲ ▲FIRST▲. ◙I just transferred in and ◙I'm here to join the ◙tennis club today...
00079
Then you're the one our ◙advisor Suzuki-sensei ◙mentioned...
00080
Manaka
00081
I'm a second year in the ◙girls' tennis club, ◙Takane Manaka. Let's get ◙along, okay？
00082
(Wow, her smile is also ◙cute...)
00083
So then, what is it that ◙you need？
00084
Ah, that's right！I'm ◙looking for Suzuki-sensei. ◙He wasn't in the staff ◙room. Do you know where ◙he is？
00085
Suzuki-sensei always takes ◙a nap on the roof during ◙lunchtime. So surely...
00086
I got it. The roof？ ◙How do I get to the roof？
00087
Hehe... Then I'll take you ◙there.
00088
What about the cleaning？ ◙Aren't you on duty？
00089
It's dangerous to play ◙with leaves on the court, ◙so I was just cleaning it ◙on my own.
00090
I see. Then, if you don't ◙mind.
00091
Always help out one ◙another when in trouble, ◙right？
00092
(▲MANAKA▲, huh？ ◙I'm sure my new life will ◙have good things！)
00093
○○○○○○○○
00094
Excuse me. I came to turn ◙in my club application ◙form. Is Suzuki-sensei of ◙the tennis club here？
00095
Teacher
00096
Suzuki-sensei just left. ◙Why don't you try looking ◙around the tennis courts？
00097
Is that so？ Okay, then.
00098
(There's no one here... ◙It's so cold！)
00099
(I'll head for the ◙clubroom...)
00100
(Even out in this cold, ◙there's someone cleaning ◙the clubroom？)
00101
Um, excuse me！
00102
？？？
00103
Yes！
00104
Yes. Is there something I ◙can help you with？
00105
(Wow, what a beautiful ◙girl... I wonder if she ◙is the manager...)
00106
Um, is there something...？
00107
Ah, I am a second year, ◙▲LAST▲　▲FIRST▲. ◙I just transferred in. ◙I came to turn in my club ◙application form, but I ◙can't find the advisor...
00108
Then you must be the new ◙member that Suzuki-sensei ◙mentioned...
00109
That's probably me, ◙I guess. Can I give you ◙my club application form, ◙Manager？
00110
Hehe...
00111
？
00112
Manaka
00113
I'm a second year in the ◙girls' tennis club, Takane ◙Manaka. I'm actually a player.
00114
Team member？ Since you ◙were cleaning the clubroom ◙by yourself, I thought...
00115
I wanted to clean the ◙room before the new member ◙arrived. I just finished.
00116
Is that so？ Thank you.
00117
You're welcome. I'll turn ◙in the club application ◙form to Suzuki-sensei, ◙okay？
00118
Sorry to trouble you.
00119
Always help out one ◙another when in trouble, ◙right？
00120
(▲MANAKA▲, huh？ ◙I'm sure my new life will ◙have good things！)
