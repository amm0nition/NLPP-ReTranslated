Manaka
00001
Hey, lately, have you found ◙anything interesting on TV？
00002
○○○○○○○○
00003
Huh？ But do you watch TV ◙at your house, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00004
Yeah, the channels that I ◙can watch have already been ◙decided.
00005
But if there's any program ◙you find interesting, I ◙might ask for permission ◙from my parents so that I ◙can watch it, too.
00006
I see.
00007
But, it would be better if ◙it's not variety show...
00008
Ah, romance drama isn't ◙good either...
00009
If it's an intellectual ◙quiz show or cooking show, ◙it might be easier to ask ◙them.
00010
What do you think？
00011
(Honestly, this is just a ◙little too difficult...)
00012
Manaka
00013
Earlier, I asked you ◙whether you knew any ◙interesting TV program. ◙Did you remember？
00014
○○○○○○○○
00015
Yeah, I remembered. Why？
00016
Well, I asked Mama to help ◙me talk to Papa about it. ◙She did, but...
00017
They started to quarrel ◙because of that.
00018
Ah, so it's really ◙difficult to persuade your ◙father, huh？
00019
No, Papa isn't as strict as ◙you might think he is.
00020
Then why？
00021
Now Mama, who usually has ◙a smile on her face, seems ◙to be very upset but she ◙didn't tell me why...
00022
I already apologized to her ◙because it was my fault ◙asking her to talk with ◙Papa about the TV program.
00023
But I don't think the TV ◙program is the problem ◙here. I really don't know ◙what to do...
00024
(Somehow, it turned into a ◙family problem...)
00025
○○○○○○○○
00026
Say, have your parents ◙reconciled yet？
00027
Manaka
00028
No... not yet.
00029
I see...
00030
Ah, but they said okay to ◙the cooking show. Only once ◙per week, but that's good ◙enough.
00031
Wow, you did it ！
00032
Hehe, thanks. It's thanks ◙to your cooperation.
00033
But how come your parents ◙still haven't reconciled？
00034
Papa didn't have a clue ◙why Mama was so angry.
00035
Papa told me that he might ◙have said something that ◙he shouldn't have said... ◙but he had no idea what it ◙was.
00036
Mama only said, "I don't ◙know why men are always ◙like this." and continued ◙being angry with Papa.
00037
(I have to be careful about ◙this...)
00038
○○○○○○○○
00039
Has peace returned to the ◙Takanes yet？
00040
Manaka
00041
Yeah, finally. Thanks for ◙asking.
00042
Did your parents find the ◙cause of their argument？
00043
I guess so... Mama didn't ◙tell me, though.
00044
Why？
00045
It seems that it's a secret ◙between my parents.
00046
It was the first time I ◙saw them quarreled, so I ◙didn't know what to do. ◙But they said that I ◙shouldn't be worried.
00047
Haha, I see. But it's good ◙that they reconciled.
00048
Yeah. Now they've become ◙so lovey-dovey and I start ◙to think that quarrelling ◙wasn't totally a bad thing.
00049
Y-You mean...
00050
Hehe. Just kidding. We'll ◙always be nice to each ◙other, okay？
00051
Manaka
00052
Hey, how much do you know ◙about cell phones？
00053
○○○○○○○○
00054
Eh？ Why？
00055
Papa asked me how to change ◙the ring tone, but...
00056
I didn't know how to do ◙that.
00057
Did you read the manual？
00058
We tried to find it but we ◙couldn't. Papa probably ◙threw it away after he ◙finished using it.
00059
I couldn't even change a ◙single ring tone and he ◙asked me to personalize ◙each ring tone for each ◙caller.
00060
Hah... I'll have to try ◙and find the manual...
00061
(This seems like a ◙difficult job for her...)
00062
○○○○○○○○
00063
By the way, did you find ◙the cell phone's manual？
00064
Manaka
00065
No. But, I finally managed ◙to change the default ring ◙tone to something else.
00066
How did you do that？
00067
Papa and I were trying ◙different settings until it ◙worked, but it's still ◙difficult to assign ring ◙tones for each caller.
00068
I see...
00069
I suggested that he should ◙take it to the store, but ◙he didn't want to.
00070
...He'd be ashamed, right？
00071
You know a lot, huh？ I ◙think Papa won't give up ◙until he can change it by ◙himself.
00072
He's such a stubborn ◙person, so it can't be ◙helped, huh？
00073
(Your unyielding spirit is ◙probably hereditary ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00074
○○○○○○○○
00075
Did you figure out how to ◙change the ring tone？
00076
Manaka
00077
I finally did.
00078
Oh, as I expected. Now your ◙dad can feel at ease now, ◙right？
00079
That's...
00080
...Eh？
00081
He has become even more ◙stubborn.
00082
Ah...
00083
I kind of understand him so ◙I didn't say anything.
00084
Even if he finds the ◙manual, he probably won't ◙use it. I wonder if he's ◙still fumbling with it ◙now...
00085
(In the end, things became ◙even more complicated for ◙him, huh...？)
00086
○○○○○○○○
00087
How was your dad after the ◙issue with the cell phone？
00088
Manaka
00089
Well... Mama ended up ◙changing the ring tone for ◙him.
00090
Eh！？
00091
And, while Papa was still ◙shocked to speak, Mama ◙just explained to him how ◙to change it.
00092
He didn't get mad at all？
00093
No. He just said "Okay" ◙and obediently took the ◙cell phone from Mama. He ◙even thanked her properly.
00094
Hmm...？ Compared to what ◙you told me about him ◙earlier, I'd say that this ◙is very unexpected.
00095
Mama said that for a person ◙like Papa, he had to take ◙it the hard way. She told ◙me it was called "Shock ◙Therapy."
00096
Your mom really knows how ◙to handle him.
00097
It seemed like she found ◙the manual and learned how ◙to do it. Now everything is ◙settled, I think.
00098
(When I have a chance to ◙meet her mom, I'd better ◙learn something from her.)
00099
Manaka
00100
Ah, right. I have to return ◙a recipe book to Miki-chan.
00101
○○○○○○○○
00102
Miki-chan？
00103
Yeah. I haven't told you ◙about her？
00104
This is the first time I've ◙heard you mentioned this ◙name.
00105
I see. Well, she's been my ◙friend since grade school. ◙We go to different high ◙schools, but we still keep ◙in touch.
00106
She said that she has never ◙read this book after she ◙bought it, and she lent it ◙to me.
00107
She has never read it...？ ◙That means it's like a ◙brand new book？
00108
Yeah, she felt satisfied ◙just to have the book.
00109
That's the feeling I can ◙never understand. She is ◙very different from me but ◙that makes it really fun to ◙talk with her. Hehe.
00110
(So she's like the exact ◙opposite of you, huh？)
00111
Manaka
00112
I met up with Miki-chan◙earlier.
00113
○○○○○○○○
00114
Ah, the girl who's like the ◙exact opposite of ◙▲MANAKA▲, right？
00115
Hehe. Right. I went to ◙return the book to her but ◙ended up borrowing another ◙recipe book from her.
00116
Eh？ Is it another brand ◙new book that she has never ◙read？
00117
No, she tried the recipes ◙in this book so many times ◙but her attempts always ◙failed.
00118
She asked me to be her ◙coach, so I'll have to try ◙these recipes by myself ◙first.
00119
Be her coach？
00120
Yeah. She wants to make ◙pudding for the guy she ◙likes. I'll try my best to ◙help her. Hehe.
00121
I see. I hope it comes out ◙nicely. Do your best, ◙coach.
00122
Okay, I'll do my best▼
00123
○○○○○○○○
00124
Did you successfully teach ◙your friend how to make ◙pudding？
00125
Manaka
00126
Hmm...
00127
Eh？ It failed？
00128
I know that she hasn't been ◙very good at cooking since ◙a long time ago, but...
00129
I think it has gone beyond ◙my imagination...
00130
W-What happened？
00131
I wonder why things turned ◙out like this. If only I ◙could find out the ◙reason...！
00132
(This girl must really be ◙the exact opposite of ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00133
○○○○○○○○
00134
Did you find the cause of ◙failure for the pudding ◙last time？
00135
Manaka
00136
No, I still have no clue. ◙I've tried eating so many ◙puddings that I think I ◙can't possibly eat them ◙anymore.
00137
You've eaten so many of ◙them...？ Well, how was the ◙result of her latest ◙attempt then？
00138
Right on the passing line. ◙I think she's going to give ◙it to the guy today.
00139
I see. So you've done a ◙great job.
00140
Hehe. Thanks. Hey, will you ◙celebrate this with me？
00141
Ah, okay. Where shall we ◙go for the celebration？
00142
I want to eat cake▼
00143
Eh！Hmm, I thought you'd be ◙fed up with sweets by now.
00144
That was pudding. Cake is ◙a completely different ◙thing, isn't it？
00145
Is that so...？
00146
That is so. Hehe, let's go！
00147
(Girls are amazing...)
00148
Manaka
00149
My neighbor's dog just ◙gave birth to puppies.
00150
○○○○○○○○
00151
Oh, how many of them？
00152
Five, I guess. I'm going ◙to visit them soon.
00153
It must be fun.
00154
Yeah. I can picture them ◙rolling around. They must ◙be so cute that I could ◙eat them！ Just imagining ◙though.
00155
Thinking of them that I ◙couldn't sleep.
00156
I didn't have enough sleep ◙but I'm not feeling tired ◙at all！ It's just so ◙amazing.
00157
(You'll get very sleepy ◙later tonight for sure.)
00158
Manaka
00159
I can't wait to see the ◙puppies...
00160
○○○○○○○○
00161
You still haven't seen ◙those puppies yet？
00162
Not yet. I've got a lot to ◙do that I don't have time ◙to visit them.
00163
I see. By the way, On the ◙day that we talked about ◙this, were you okay after ◙that？
00164
Eh？ What do you mean？
00165
You said that you didn't ◙have enough sleep but you ◙weren't tired. How was it ◙after all？
00166
...Well. I was so sleepy ◙after I got home. I tried ◙my best to stay awake ◙until dinnertime, but...
00167
I fell asleep while I was ◙having dinner, just like a ◙kid.
00168
And Papa even recorded that ◙on a video. I tried to ◙delete it but he hid his ◙camcorder somewhere.
00169
Papa and Mama said that I ◙was cute, but it's really ◙embarrassing.
00170
I have to look for it when ◙I get home.
00171
(I'm more interested in ◙this video than the ◙puppies...)
00172
○○○○○○○○
00173
By the way, have you seen ◙the puppies yet？
00174
Manaka
00175
Not yet. But I got a chance ◙to talk to my neighbor ◙yesterday...
00176
"They're very healthy and ◙naughty. It must be hard ◙for Manaka-chan," she said.
00177
She showed me their photos ◙too！ They're just really ◙cute！ And then...
00178
That night, you couldn't ◙sleep, right, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00179
...How did you know！？
00180
I just knew it...
00181
...I was so excited about ◙them. I couldn’t help it.
00182
(I wonder what will happen ◙to her when she meets the ◙puppies.)
00183
○○○○○○○○
00184
How about the puppies？
00185
Manaka
00186
Well, I played with them ◙all day long. And by the ◙time I realized it, it was ◙already dawn.
00187
Eh？！
00188
I guess I played with them ◙too much that I ended up ◙falling asleep.
00189
The mother dog even came ◙and slept next to me.
00190
My neighbor saw it and ◙didn't want to wake me, so ◙she asked my Mama to let ◙me spend the night there.
00191
During that time, she even ◙took a picture of me.
00192
I want to see！
00193
No. I was sleeping like a ◙little kid. That was so ◙embarrassing.
00194
But it was really fun. ◙My neighbor said that I ◙should visit them again. ◙I think I soon will.
00195
(You are getting very ◙excited about them. I guess ◙you'll visit them again ◙very soon, right ◙▲MANAKA▲...？)
00196
Manaka
00197
I was wondering if you know ◙any Russian cuisine.
00198
○○○○○○○○
00199
Russian cuisine...？ Such as ◙pierogi？ Why do you ask？
00200
Lately, I've been into ◙foreign foods. Now it's ◙Russian cuisine.
00201
Hmm. Have you tried cooking ◙some dishes？
00202
Yeah. I tried the boiled ◙dumpling called pelmeni. ◙It's stuffed with minced ◙meat, onions, and potatoes.
00203
Dumpling with potatoes ◙filling？ Sounds like a ◙croquette.
00204
Hehe. But this one is ◙boiled and you can eat it ◙with sour cream sauce on ◙top.
00205
Sounds yummy...
00206
It was delicious. Papa even ◙asked for another serving ◙of it.
00207
I want to eat it, too...
00208
Hehe, someday, okay？ Now I ◙have to think what I'll ◙make next.
00209
Manaka
00210
Have you heard of Janssons ◙frestelse？
00211
○○○○○○○○
00212
Huh？ What's that？
00213
Hehe. It's the name of a ◙dish.
00214
Ah, you're still obsessed ◙with foreign foods, huh？
00215
That's right. This time ◙it's Swedish food.
00216
Hmm？ What kind of dish is ◙it？
00217
To make it easy for you to ◙understand, it's quite ◙like gratin.
00218
It has sauteed potatoes, ◙onions, and anchovies ◙mixed with fresh cream and ◙milk. Then it's baked in an ◙oven.
00219
...Sounds yummy.
00220
Hehe. It was very ◙delicious▼
00221
I wonder what other ◙country's food I should ◙make next.
00222
(I want to try someー！)
00223
○○○○○○○○
00224
Are you still obsessed with ◙foreign cuisine？
00225
Manaka
00226
Yeah. Last time, I ◙challenged myself with a ◙French dish.
00227
It's called pomme souffle. ◙It's usually served with ◙the main dish, so it's more ◙like a side dish, but I ◙find it interesting.
00228
Oh, what kind of dish is ◙it？
00229
It's made from potatoes ◙and it's fried until it ◙puffs out. I had fun making ◙it, but it was quite ◙difficult...
00230
The way I sliced and ◙stirred the ingredients and ◙the oil's temperature. ◙Missing any of these and ◙it could fail.
00231
It's made from potatoes？
00232
Yeah. It was impossible to ◙make it perfectly but I ◙was quite satisfied with ◙the result.
00233
It's about time to look for ◙a new recipe.
00234
(Hmm... She's very into ◙it...)
00235
○○○○○○○○
00236
Hey, how's your cooking ◙going？
00237
Manaka
00238
Um, it's going nicely. ◙Last time, I tried making ◙gnocchi. It was made with ◙wheat flour and potatoes...
00239
Hey, I've been concerned ◙about it for a while. Why ◙did you only cook potato ◙dishes？
00240
...You noticed？
00241
Yeah, ever since you ◙mentioned that souffle ◙dish.
00242
Actually, my aunt sent a ◙big package of potatoes to ◙my house. We've been giving ◙them out but there are ◙still a lot left.
00243
So you tried cooking ◙something out of them？
00244
Yeah, I'm glad I could try ◙making various dishes ◙although I ended up eating ◙them by myself.
00245
You ate them by yourself？
00246
Papa and Mama said they ◙could only eat them every ◙once in a while. So, I ate ◙the gnocchi I made ◙yesterday all by myself.
00247
It was delicious. Too bad ◙my parents couldn't eat it.
00248
(No matter how delicious ◙potatoes are, eating them ◙for a whole month is a ◙little...)
00249
Manaka
00250
Earlier, I went to Papa's ◙hospital and ran into an ◙old lady who was Papa's ◙patient. We had a long chat.
00251
○○○○○○○○
00252
Huh？ With your dad's ◙patient？
00253
Yeah, and while we were ◙talking, more people joined ◙us... In the end, there ◙were as many as 7 people.
00254
All of them were your ◙dad's patients, eh？
00255
I think they were.
00256
That's why they all knew ◙me... They mentioned some ◙embarrassing stuff I did ◙when I was a child.
00257
Later, they even brought ◙up the topic about my ◙future husband.
00258
They said if Mama still ◙didn't have anyone on her ◙mind, they'd help her find ◙a match for me. They were ◙so enthusiastic.
00259
(I can picture how the ◙scene would look like...)
00260
Manaka
00261
Lately, I told you about ◙the old lady who really ◙likes to chat, right？
00262
○○○○○○○○
00263
Yeah, I remembered. Don't ◙tell me you got caught up ◙with her again.
00264
Geez, I wouldn't get caught ◙up that easily. I was able ◙to leave her much earlier ◙than last time.
00265
Haha, okay. But why do you ◙look so troubled now？
00266
Um... About that...
00267
She asked me to become her ◙grandson's bride...
00268
What！？
00269
Of course, I took it as a ◙joke and refused, but she ◙was pressing me on meeting ◙him at least once.
00270
Hah, now I'm in trouble...
00271
(The one in trouble right ◙now is me！)
00272
○○○○○○○○
00273
Earlier？ Ah！
00274
Manaka
00275
Earlier？ Oh, you mean...
00276
...I ended up promising ◙that lady that I would go ◙visit her home.
00277
Whaaaat！？
00278
I'll go with Mama to visit ◙that lady and her grandson.
00279
...But then, about you ◙being his bride...
00280
That's not a problem... I ◙guess.
00281
You guess！？
00282
Yeah, Mama will go with me, ◙so you can rest assured.
00283
(Whaaaat~！？)
00284
○○○○○○○○
00285
Speaking of which, how did ◙it go with that lady's ◙grandson ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00286
Manaka
00287
Ah！ Oh, I'm sorry. I really ◙haven't told you, right？
00288
Now I understand why the ◙old lady insisted that I ◙should meet her grandson.
00289
Eh？
00290
He really liked me... When ◙I was about to leave, he ◙didn't want to let go of ◙my hand.
00291
Your hand...
00292
Hehe, he's a baby boy, so ◙that couldn't be helped.
00293
Huh？ A baby？
00294
Yeah, her grandson was ◙very cute. That's why she ◙insisted that I should ◙meet him.
00295
So, that's about it. I'm ◙sorry I made you worried.
00296
(...But that lady might be ◙serious about the bride ◙thing, huh？)
00297
Manaka
00298
There are so many different ◙types of magazines, right？
00299
○○○○○○○○
00300
Yeah. If you go to a large ◙bookstore, you can see a ◙lot of magazines sorted by ◙categories.
00301
Right. Even fashion ◙magazines have different ◙targeted ages... It's ◙troublesome when you can't ◙tell them apart.
00302
Ah, they're grouped for ◙ages 10+, 20+, and 30+. ◙Something like that, right？
00303
Right. And I've notice a ◙new vocab "Around 4" ◙lately.
00304
...What does that mean？
00305
It means people around the ◙age of 40. Hehe, it's such ◙a strange word.
00306
But I feel like I should ◙start learning some of ◙these new vocabs.
00307
If I learn something new, ◙I'll teach you. Let's ◙study together.
00308
(Do I have to study ◙something like this too？)
00309
Manaka
00310
Quiz time.
00311
○○○○○○○○
00312
Hmm？ Ah, about the fashion ◙terms？ Okay then.
00313
"Around 3."
00314
If "Around 4" means people ◙around the age of 40 then ◙"Around 3" must be people ◙around the age of 30, ◙right？
00315
Correct！ Then the next one, ◙"B-Type."
00316
B-Type？ Doesn't it mean ◙blood type B？
00317
Boo！ Then how about ◙"conserver"？
00318
...A console game server？
00319
Hehe, nice guess, but ◙wrong！
00320
For the correct answers, ◙"B-Type" means hip hop ◙culture, and "conserver" ◙is conservative fashion.
00321
That's all. Too bad some ◙of your answers were wrong. ◙Hehe.
00322
(You studied really hard ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00323
○○○○○○○○
00324
Did you learn any new ◙vocabs？
00325
Manaka
00326
Yeah. But I only read a ◙few magazines, so I didn't ◙learn much.
00327
Hmm？ So earlier, did you ◙just buy some random ◙magazines and read them？
00328
Yeah, because I didn't ◙really know which one I ◙should read.
00329
Wasn't that difficult？ ◙Fashion magazines aren't ◙that cheap.
00330
That's not a problem, since ◙I found out that our ◙library also carries ◙fashion magazines for ◙studying purpose.
00331
Huh？ There are magazines ◙at the library too？
00332
I was also surprised when ◙I found out. They even have ◙comics, too.
00333
Next time, I might secretly ◙borrow some comics...
00334
(Your parents forbid you ◙from reading comics too, ◙▲MANAKA▲？)
00335
○○○○○○○○
00336
Well, do you still keep ◙reading the fashion ◙magazines？
00337
Manaka
00338
Yeah, I've read a lot of ◙them, so I've learned many ◙things about fashion.
00339
But I haven't really put it ◙into practice. There are ◙clothes that I want, but ◙my pocket money is limited.
00340
I've been thinking about ◙getting a part-time job, ◙but that's a bit too much.
00341
I see.
00342
Lately, I'm enjoying ◙reading columns about ◙cosmetics as well.
00343
I've never had interest in ◙such things before...
00344
Since I've met you, it's ◙like my world has ◙broadened. Thank you.
00345
(That's something I should ◙say to her, too...)
00346
Manaka
00347
Have you ever gotten caught ◙up when you did some ◙cleaning？
00348
○○○○○○○○
00349
Ah, did you find some old ◙photo albums？
00350
Hehe. How did you know？ ◙Were you watching me？
00351
Bull's eyes, huh...？
00352
I got lots of stuff, so I ◙was thinking about sorting ◙them out. Then I found my ◙childhood albums and I ◙stopped cleaning.
00353
Okay okay, I understand.
00354
When I realized it, it was ◙already dark. I didn't get ◙much done, so I'd have to ◙do the cleaning again ◙later.
00355
Do you think you'll get ◙caught up with something ◙else next time？
00356
Come on, don't imagine ◙weird things.
00357
Hey, don't jinx me like ◙that... But I feel like ◙it'll happen.
00358
(I think so too...)
00359
○○○○○○○○
00360
How was it？ Did you ◙continue on with the ◙cleaning？
00361
Manaka
00362
...It's all your fault.
00363
W-What？
00364
I found my diary when I ◙was in grade school.
00365
And then my penmanship ◙practice book, and my ◙ballet shoes... A lot of ◙things.
00366
Everything was so tempting, ◙right？
00367
Yeah, but I packed them ◙all up and put them in ◙another room. So I'll be ◙okay next time！
00368
...I guess. Yeah.
00369
(I wonder...)
00370
○○○○○○○○
00371
Did you finish cleaning？
00372
Manaka
00373
No, not yet.
00374
Eh？ What could possibly get ◙you occupied this time？
00375
I was rearranging a lot of ◙stuff and Mama came to see ◙how it was going. And then ◙we were deep in talk.
00376
I see...
00377
But it was fun. We talked ◙about a lot of things.
00378
...It was like women's ◙private talk. There were ◙things we couldn't say if ◙Papa was with us.
00379
That means, there were also ◙things that you couldn't ◙talk about if I was with ◙you？
00380
Of course. Girls always ◙have many things to talk ◙about.
00381
...Could it be something ◙about me？
00382
Well, who knows？ It's a ◙secret▼
00383
(Now I'm concerned...)
00384
○○○○○○○○
00385
How's the cleaning going？
00386
Manaka
00387
Well, it's finally done. ◙My room is pretty tidy now.
00388
I see. Good job.
00389
Thank you. Now, it looks ◙so different.
00390
Anything else you're ◙planning to do？
00391
Yeah, from now on, I'll ◙gradually fill up the space ◙that I just made available.
00392
Hmm？
00393
That's because there are ◙many more things that will ◙fill my memories with you.
00394
Eh？ Will we have that many ◙memories together...？
00395
We'll have many！ Hehe！
00396
○○○○○○○○
00397
What do you usually do ◙before you go to bed ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00398
Manaka
00399
Before I go to bed...？ I ◙do some light stretches.
00400
Stretches？ Why？
00401
Why？ It's what I've been ◙doing since a long time ago.
00402
When I stretch, it makes ◙me feel sleepy.
00403
Even if you don't do that, ◙you always fall asleep ◙easily anyway ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00404
...It feels different when ◙I stretch, and when I ◙don't. Just a little ◙different though.
00405
How's that？
00406
That's... You know... Ah, ◙the most important thing ◙is that I can wake up ◙feeling refreshed！
00407
So yeah... you should try ◙it. You'll feel better in ◙the morning too, okay？
00408
(So she doesn't really ◙know the difference, huh？)
00409
Manaka
00410
After the last time we ◙talked, I stopped ◙stretching before I went ◙to bed.
00411
○○○○○○○○
00412
Eh？ So you stopped ◙stretching？
00413
Yeah. But I think there was ◙something different.
00414
Well, I felt quite uneasy ◙and it took me longer ◙until I could sleep.
00415
I had been stretching ever ◙since I was in grade ◙school. I think it helps ◙me feel at ease...
00416
That means there is a ◙difference, right？
00417
...Ah, right.
00418
Eh？
00419
！ Well, um... Right！ This ◙is the difference we talked ◙about earlier, right？
00420
(You've just realized it ◙now...？)
00421
Manaka
00422
I haven't read any novel ◙for a long time, but I ◙read one last night.
00423
○○○○○○○○
00424
Ah, before bedtime？
00425
Yeah. Somehow I really ◙fell asleep, and I slept ◙even deeper than when I ◙did the stretching.
00426
An immediate effect, huh？
00427
But, I didn't feel ◙refreshed when I woke up ◙in the morning.
00428
Haha, then for you, ◙stretching is the best ◙option ▲MANAKA▲.
00429
I wonder. Maybe I shouldn't ◙change my routines...
00430
It's good to follow your ◙habits, but sometimes a ◙little change is good, ◙too, right？
00431
You think so？ ...Hmm, maybe ◙that's true.
00432
Manaka
00433
Last night when I was ◙alone, I gazed at the ◙stars.
00434
○○○○○○○○
00435
Before your bedtime？
00436
Yeah, they were really ◙beautiful. I was thinking ◙about calling you last ◙night, but it was already ◙late.
00437
Really？ It would've been ◙nice if you and I had ◙looked at them at the same ◙time.
00438
I was trying to call you by ◙telepathy, didn't you get ◙it？
00439
Too bad I didn't.
00440
Hehe, then we should ◙practice so that we could ◙communicate by telepathy ◙next time.
00441
What do you mean？
00442
Before you go to bed, you ◙must think about me. How's ◙that...？
00443
With such nice weather, ◙we'll be able to see ◙beautiful stars. Let's ◙watch them together tonight.
00444
○○○○○○○○
00445
What do you do for fun ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00446
Manaka
00447
For fun？ Hmm... Like ◙baking？
00448
Baking？
00449
Yeah. It's really ◙refreshing. The kneading ◙part is really fun. ◙"Bamm！" I can hit the ◙bread as hard as I want.
00450
When I do that, even Papa ◙and Mama try their best to ◙stay away from the kitchen. ◙Hehe.
00451
......
00452
I haven't baked for a ◙while. I'll have you taste ◙some when I do, okay？
00453
(I wonder how her bread is ◙going to come out...)
00454
○○○○○○○○
00455
Thanks for the bread the ◙other day.
00456
Manaka
00457
No problem. Thanks to you, ◙I felt completely refreshed.
00458
Does that mean... you had ◙fun kneading the bread？ ◙Doing that "Bamm！" thing？
00459
Hehe, I guess so. Because ◙no one dared to enter the ◙kitchen.
00460
O-Oh, I see...
00461
I once asked Mama why she ◙didn't join me in the ◙kitchen.
00462
And what did she say？
00463
She was scared. Because I ◙hit the bread so hard, like ◙"Bamm！" but my face was ◙expressionless.
00464
......
00465
But isn't that how I look ◙when I'm getting serious ◙with something？ What do ◙you think？
00466
(Um... What should I say？)
00467
Manaka
00468
Oh, yeah. Hey, I'm thinking ◙of baking again. Do you ◙have any requests？
00469
○○○○○○○○
00470
Huh？
00471
Hmm？
00472
No... Just wondered if you ◙needed some refreshing ◙time again.
00473
Hehe, wrong. Mama bought ◙some natural yeast so we ◙planned to bake some bread ◙together.
00474
Natural yeast？
00475
Yeah. Yeast is necessary ◙for baking, but I like ◙using natural yeast the ◙most.
00476
Hmm... There really are a ◙lot of varieties, huh？
00477
Yeah, so many that I feel ◙troubled. But once I'm ◙obsessed, I totally can't ◙stop.
00478
Maybe making something ◙delicious is my current ◙obsession, I guess.
00479
(You're easily obsessed ◙with things like this, ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00480
○○○○○○○○
00481
How did it go when you were ◙baking with your mom？
00482
Manaka
00483
Well... Now I understand ◙what Mama said about my ◙expressionless face.
00484
Eh？
00485
Hehe. You see...
00486
Mama's face was also ◙expressionless when she did ◙that "Bamm！" thing！
00487
When I saw that, I was like ◙"Ah, that's it." I also ◙thought that she looked ◙scary.
00488
Scary？
00489
Yes. That's why I'll never ◙make any more bread for you ◙in my whole life.
00490
R-Really？
00491
I'm kidding▼ Hehe！
00492
Manaka
00493
What time can you stay up ◙until at night？
00494
○○○○○○○○
00495
I'm not sure... Why？
00496
Well, I'm thinking about ◙challenging myself for my ◙time limit.
00497
What for？
00498
...Well, just in case.
00499
Just in case that we had ◙to stay up all night, it ◙wouldn't be good if I fell ◙asleep first, right？
00500
Ah, I see. But it's not ◙good to overdo it.
00501
And I know you're not good ◙at staying up late, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00502
...That's why I need some ◙practice.
00503
Do you have any trick that ◙you can teach me？ If so, I ◙think I can do it. Do you？
00504
(Trick？ Is there any trick ◙for something like this？)
00505
Manaka
00506
Hey, I still wasn't able to ◙stay up late at night...
00507
○○○○○○○○
00508
You've tried this for like ◙a whole week now. It's ◙probably impossible.
00509
Hah...
00510
...Ah！ Hey, how about I ◙exercise at night？ I'll ◙feel refreshed and I can ◙stay up, right？
00511
I think it'll be the ◙opposite. You'll feel ◙tired and fall asleep.
00512
...Really？
00513
Yes. For something like ◙this, you have to get used ◙to it little by little.
00514
I see... Okay, I'll do my ◙best.
00515
(You're really putting your ◙efforts into this, right ◙▲MANAKA▲？)
00516
○○○○○○○○
00517
Hey, did you succeed in ◙extending your bedtime？
00518
Manaka
00519
A little bit！ One hour for ◙now！
00520
Oh, that's great.
00521
Hehe. But I still feel ◙sleepy at my usual time.
00522
Eh？ Really？
00523
Yeah. I have to endure it ◙more from now on.
00524
I even dozed off and hit ◙my head on my desk. That ◙was quite shocking...
00525
But I could set a new ◙record. Hehe！
00526
(If you dozed off, that ◙means you fell asleep. So ◙it wasn't a record...)
00527
○○○○○○○○
00528
After all that, did you try ◙to stay up late again ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00529
Manaka
00530
Um... I think I should ◙stop. I don't think it's ◙good for me.
00531
Did something happen？
00532
...I told you once that I ◙dozed off and hit my head ◙on my desk, right？
00533
Yeah, you did.
00534
And this time it was so ◙loud that Papa and Mama ◙panicked and ran to my ◙room.
00535
After that, I got scolded. ◙They told me there wasn't ◙anything good about ◙staying up late, and that ◙I had to stop.
00536
It was exactly the same as ◙what you told me.
00537
Yeah, and a lack of sleep ◙isn't good for your skin. ◙Your beautiful skin might ◙become rough...
00538
...Haha. Yeah, that's why ◙I try to get enough sleep ◙now.
00539
I'll try my best not to ◙keep playing throughout ◙the night. You must cheer ◙for me.
00540
Of course！
00541
Manaka
00542
Hey, what I'm going to tell ◙you must be kept a secret, ◙okay？
00543
○○○○○○○○
00544
O-Okay. What is it？
00545
You see, well... I... have ◙begun reading comics.
00546
Huh？ But comics weren't ◙allowed at your home, right ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00547
It has not been clearly ◙said but I think they're ◙not allowed, so I secretly ◙read them in the library.
00548
I see... By the way, what ◙do you read？
00549
A comic about a female ◙tennis player. It seems to ◙be quite old but it's very ◙interesting.
00550
One time, I couldn't stop ◙reading... I forgot about ◙dinner.
00551
A glutton like you did！？ ◙That's really amazing ◙▲MANAKA▲！
00552
Right？ Yeah, I really ◙wanted to read the next ◙volume.
00553
(For a glutton... that's ◙amazing... Comic Power！)
00554
○○○○○○○○
00555
Have you continued reading ◙the comic？
00556
Manaka
00557
Oh, that？ Someone borrowed ◙the comic and I haven't ◙been able to read more.
00558
Is that so？ By the way, ◙what's the story about？
00559
About a super strict coach ◙and the intensive training ◙he gives to this girl.
00560
Coach, I can't do it！
00561
...If you keep crying like ◙this, we don't need you in ◙our tennis club anymore. ◙Go home！
00562
No... For me, tennis is ◙everything I have...
00563
Say, it's interesting, ◙isn't it？
00564
(You even did a monologue？ ◙Don't underestimate the ◙power of comic books, huh, ◙▲MANAKA▲？)
00565
○○○○○○○○
00566
Have you returned the ◙comic？
00567
Manaka
00568
Yes. It has been returned...
00569
And？
00570
I don't want to continue ◙reading it.
00571
W-Why？ You were really ◙enjoying that comic.
00572
At the pace I'm reading, ◙there's only a bit more to ◙go...
00573
In the story, the coach and ◙heroine separated.
00574
After I finish reading this ◙comic, I'm never reading ◙another one...
00575
Had I known that the story ◙was going to be this sad, ◙I wouldn't have started ◙reading.
00576
Hah...
00577
(She was so into it. I ◙kinda want to read it, too.)
00578
○○○○○○○○
00579
How was the comic？ Did you ◙finish reading it？
00580
Manaka
00581
Yeah. I couldn't resist.
00582
How was the ending？
00583
Happy ending. The coach ◙returns from abroad and ◙comes back to the heroine.
00584
I was deeply moved and I ◙wept quietly in the ◙library. Hehe.
00585
The author who could think ◙up such story is great. I ◙don't think I'd be able to ◙do that.
00586
Do you want to read ◙another comic？
00587
If there are other good ◙ones. Do you know any？
00588
Hmm, it had better be ◙something that won't make ◙you cry.
00589
Then next time... Ah, but ◙don't tell anyone about ◙this. Also, don't tell ◙anyone that I cried, okay？
00590
(So this is like I'm ◙holding one of your ◙weaknesses？)
