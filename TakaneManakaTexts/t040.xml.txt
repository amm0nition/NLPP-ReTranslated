What are you doing this ◙late？ ...Can't sleep？ ◙Then let's stay awake ◙together, okay？
00002
Manaka
00003
Still awake...？ Hehe, ◙pulling an all-nighter？ ◙...Hey, get to sleep soon, ◙will you？ I'm so sleepy.
00004
Manaka
00005
Morning. ...Teehee. Still ◙feeling so sleepy？ ◙Your eyes look so bleary▼
00006
Manaka
00007
Morning... If we lived ◙together, I could give ◙you a good morning call ◙every day ...I guess.
00008
Manaka
00009
Morning. Eh？ A morning ◙kiss to wake you up？ If ◙the one I'm kissing is ◙you... I guess I can do ◙that.
00010
Manaka
00011
Morning. I feel so good ◙today. It must be because ◙I can see you in the ◙morning. Yeah... Teehee！
00012
Manaka
00013
Have you eaten your lunch？ ◙If you only eat instant ◙food, it'll eventually ◙affect your health. ◙Be careful, okay？
00014
Manaka
00015
Are you hungry？ What？ ◙What do you want to eat？ ◙I might take your special ◙request？
00016
Manaka
00017
Lunch always makes me feel ◙sleepy. What about you？ ◙Do you want to sleep on ◙my lap？ ...No, I won't let ◙you. Teehee！
00018
Manaka
00019
I can't handle only seeing ◙you at school... Hey, I ◙really want to spend more ◙time with you...
00020
Manaka
00021
I have to prepare dinner ◙soon. Someday, I'll make ◙yours too... Teehee, never ◙mind▼
00022
Manaka
00023
Hey, what are you doing ◙right now？ If it's not too ◙much trouble, then... ◙No, nothing. Forget it.
00024
Manaka
00025
Do you want me to help ◙you with your homework？ ◙Hmm, I'm not sure if it's ◙good for you though. ◙Hehe, just kidding！
00026
Manaka
00027
When you take a bath, ◙don't use cold water, ◙okay？ ...If you catch a ◙cold, we won't be able to ◙see each other...
00028
Manaka
00029
Before I go to sleep, I ◙always think about you. ◙Geez, don't make me say ◙such embarrassing things.
00030
Manaka
00031
Are you going to sleep？ ◙I really want to be with ◙you much longer... ◙However, I'm worried about ◙your health.
00032
Manaka
00033
Going to sleep already？ ◙Yeah, I'm sleepy, too... ◙But, I still want to be ◙together with you...
00034
Manaka
00035
I'm getting so sleepy. ◙We'll meet again tomorrow ◙and you'll come to see ◙me, right？ I'll be waiting ◙for you...
00036
Manaka
00037
I'm so glad you came to ◙see me. The truth is, I've ◙been so lonely... Don't ◙leave me alone, okay？
00038
Manaka
00039
Lately you always come to ◙see me, eh？ Thank you. ◙Is it okay to be this ◙happy？ Hehehe！
00040
Manaka
00041
Hm？
00042
Manaka
00043
Hey, hey... Teehee！
00044
Manaka
00045
Hey. Teehee...
