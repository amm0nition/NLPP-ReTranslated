Manaka
00001
Hey, a question.
00002
○○○○○○○○
00003
Huh？
00004
I've been wondering about ◙this since grade school. ◙Why are guys always so ◙energetic during the ◙cleaning period？
00005
Hmm, I also wonder why.
00006
They pretend to get into ◙sword battles, and they ◙play baseball or something ◙else.
00007
If they put that energy ◙into cleaning, they could ◙finish it much faster.
00008
Haha, that's right.
00009
How can I make them focus ◙on cleaning？ Do you have ◙any ideas？
00010
Rather, why don't you try ◙to join in and have fun ◙with them？ Try and find out ◙the truth, Great Detective ◙Manaka！
00011
...Don't answer half- ◙heartedly. Just forget it.
00012
(I really thought it was a ◙nice idea, though...)
00013
○○○○○○○○
00014
By the way, how has the ◙cleaning case gone？
00015
Manaka
00016
I warned the guys a little ◙bit and what they said ◙was... "Takane is always ◙serious."
00017
That's your good point. But ◙I don't think they still ◙think of you that way, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00018
It's fine. It's true ◙anyway...
00019
But...
00020
I don't think it's good to ◙have people say that to me ◙too often.
00021
Now, I'm considering the ◙method you suggested ◙earlier.
00022
My method... Was it...？
00023
Hehe... I'm not going to ◙let them off easily.
00024
(Now she's burning with an ◙unyielding spirit...！)
00025
○○○○○○○○
00026
How did it go？ I mean, ◙with the cleaning event, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00027
Manaka
00028
Haha, I beat them on ◙everything, from sword ◙fighting to baseball.
00029
A-As expected... And then？
00030
Um, and then... Well...
00031
Hmm？
00032
Playing with the guys was ◙really fun.
00033
So, I made a condition that ◙we could play once we ◙finished cleaning, and they ◙finished the cleaning ◙really fast.
00034
...Now, occasionally, I ◙become their comrade.
00035
Eh！？
00036
Ah, only occasionally. Just ◙when they don't have enough ◙people... So, you don't ◙have to worry.
00037
(It's something she ◙couldn't do in her ◙childhood, so she is ◙enjoying it now, huh？)
00038
○○○○○○○○
00039
Did you enjoy sword ◙fighting during the ◙cleaning period？
00040
Manaka
00041
Haha, the guys did.
00042
Eh？ How about you then, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00043
I was concentrating on the ◙cleaning, since I already ◙accomplished what I wanted ◙to do.
00044
I see. I kind of wanted to ◙see you dueling with a ◙sword though, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00045
...There's also another ◙reason I quit.
00046
...？
00047
I played so seriously that ◙people started gathering to ◙watch... I even got scouted ◙by someone from the fencing ◙club.
00048
The fencing club？
00049
Yeah. I was told, "You have ◙potential. It's not too ◙late to start now！".
00050
It's impossible, and for a ◙girl to join the fencing ◙club, it's just... Well...
00051
Anyway, it was fun. Thanks ◙to you, now I have ◙experienced something new ◙in this world. Thank you.
00052
(I feel like I helped her ◙open the door to a new ◙world somehow...)
00053
Manaka
00054
Here. These are some sweets ◙I made during home ◙economics class. They are ◙black soy bean cookies.
00055
○○○○○○○○
00056
Oh, thank you. I'll eat ◙them at home.
00057
Hehe, you really have to ◙eat them. I went through ◙hardships for them.
00058
Went through hardships, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00059
Making them wasn't that ◙difficult, but...
00060
A girl in my group tasted ◙one of them and said it was ◙delicious, and then other ◙girls from different groups ◙came to try them.
00061
I thought I had made plenty ◙of them, but when I ◙realized it, only five were ◙left. That was such a ◙surprise.
00062
Things went out of control, ◙huh...？
00063
Yeah, it was like that. ◙Now, I'm getting scared of ◙the next cooking class.
00064
Next time we have to make ◙a madeleine cake and the ◙amount I can bake is ◙limited...
00065
(Seems like it's gonna ◙cause an uproar...)
00066
○○○○○○○○
00067
How was your home economics ◙class？
00068
Manaka
00069
Oh, yeah, here is your ◙portion of the madeleine ◙cake.
00070
Thank you... You wrapped it ◙very nicely.
00071
Yes. I had to protect this ◙last piece with my life. ◙It was quite an uproar. ◙How should I put it...？
00072
It was like a scene you saw ◙in news reports about ◙bargain sales on New Year's.
00073
Wow... To that extent...
00074
If you have to cook ◙something next time, you ◙don't have to bring it back ◙for me. I'll be fine.
00075
Thank you. Hehe. Now, all ◙my tiredness has gone away.
00076
The next class is ◙handicraft, so I should be ◙fine... Probably.
00077
(You said "Probably"？ Even ◙you weren't sure about it ◙▲MANAKA▲？)
00078
○○○○○○○○
00079
Was everything okay during ◙home economics class？
00080
Manaka
00081
The class was fine, but ◙things went crazy when we ◙learned that we were making ◙desserts next.
00082
It became a big uproar, and ◙I ended up promising to let ◙everyone try my desserts.
00083
I see... But how come ◙things turned out like ◙that？
00084
I wonder why. This never ◙happened before. It only ◙happened after I started ◙dating you...
00085
......
00086
Wait a minute！ I didn't ◙do anything！！？
00087
...Right. Sorry. But I ◙can't think of other ◙reasons.
00088
Why is that...？
00089
(You changed since we ◙started dating, huh, ◙▲MANAKA▲...？)
00090
○○○○○○○○
00091
About the home economics ◙class, did you find out the ◙reason, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00092
Manaka
00093
Not yet, Watson. The ◙mystery has deepened.
00094
Hahaha, let me give you a ◙hint.
00095
Eh...？
00096
You often say that you have ◙changed since we met right, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00097
Yeah.
00098
What if we aren't the only ◙ones who noticed？
00099
...You mean, the reason ◙everyone has changed is ◙because I've changed...？
00100
I wonder. How about you ask ◙them next time？
00101
...Okay！ I will！
00102
(Can I say that this case ◙is closed this time？)
00103
Manaka
00104
By the way, there were a ◙lot of students sleeping ◙during physics class.
00105
○○○○○○○○
00106
Haha, the teacher's voice ◙sounded like a lullaby to ◙them, I guess.
00107
They were sleeping soundly, ◙even tossing left and ◙right.
00108
And one of the guys pushed ◙a pencil box off the desk ◙while he was asleep.
00109
Ah, yeah. Something like ◙that could happen.
00110
Hehe. And that guy was ◙startled by the sound and ◙suddenly stood up. You know ◙what he said？
00111
He shouted, "I'm not ◙sleeping！" out loud, but ◙the teacher didn't get ◙angry at him.
00112
Why？
00113
He seemed to be amused by ◙what that student said.
00114
The teacher couldn't stop ◙laughing until the class ◙ended. I wonder if he'll ◙be able to concentrate on ◙teaching next time.
00115
I can't wait until the ◙next class, but I'm also ◙worried that my class will ◙fall behind schedule. ◙Anyway, I can't wait.
00116
(You're looking forward to ◙it, huh？)
00117
○○○○○○○○
00118
How was your physics class？
00119
Manaka
00120
The teacher really tried ◙his best.
00121
Which means he didn't laugh ◙in the classroom？
00122
Yeah, but...
00123
Although physics class was ◙usually boring, he changed ◙the pace somehow, so not as ◙many students fell asleep ◙this time.
00124
Hmm... It was an unexpected ◙improvement then.
00125
I guess. But even so, that ◙guy was still falling ◙asleep.
00126
Hahaha, did he do anything ◙funny again this time？
00127
Yeah, a lot of people were ◙looking forward to it. I'd ◙prefer that he paid more ◙attention in class.
00128
...But I was also hoping ◙for something fun. Just a ◙little.
00129
(You're really looking ◙forward to it, huh...？)
00130
○○○○○○○○
00131
How's that guy doing？
00132
Manaka
00133
Ah, the one that usually ◙falls asleep in class？
00134
Usually, his head would ◙tilt left and right when he ◙dozed off, but this time it ◙was swaying back and forth.
00135
His head almost hit the ◙chair when it tilted back, ◙and when it finally ◙returned forward, it hit ◙the desk like "Bang"！
00136
That must gave hurt...
00137
Yeah, I think it hurt. His ◙pencil box was dented and ◙his forehead was all red.
00138
Whoa...
00139
But this should teach him ◙to pay attention in class, ◙right？
00140
The class has become more ◙enjoyable, so he should ◙take it seriously. It's ◙killing two birds with one ◙stone.
00141
...But it'll be a little ◙disappointing not being ◙able to see any more funny ◙things in class.
00142
(I wonder if he'll stop ◙falling asleep in class.)
00143
○○○○○○○○
00144
How's that guy who usually ◙falls asleep in class？
00145
Manaka
00146
Things didn't go perfectly ◙but he didn't fall asleep ◙as much as he used to.
00147
It must hurt badly when he ◙hit his head on the desk.
00148
I guess so, but now he ◙seems to really enjoy ◙physics.
00149
Why is that？
00150
He finds it interesting now ◙that he had a first-hand ◙experience of pendulum ◙mechanisms when he dozed ◙off last time.
00151
I doubt if such mechanisms ◙are related to physics...
00152
I doubt it too. Anyway, it ◙was kind of his self- ◙awakening.
00153
Yeah, certainly.
00154
Seeing that student, the ◙teacher also got fired up. ◙I think physics class has ◙become totally different ◙now.
00155
(I kind of look forward to ◙my physics class, too.)
00156
Manaka
00157
My next P.E. class will be ◙creative dance.
00158
○○○○○○○○
00159
Huh？ Creative dance？
00160
Yeah, we have to form a ◙team and think about a ◙choreography to match the ◙music, but...
00161
But？
00162
There's one girl in my ◙group that's very good at ◙dancing, so everyone is ◙letting her design the ◙dance moves.
00163
Isn't that good？ Seems like ◙your group has the ◙advantage.
00164
Yeah, but I wonder if it'll ◙turn out to be outrageous. ◙I'm a little worried.
00165
Outrageous？
00166
All my teammates are from ◙sports clubs. They'll ◙certainly decide on some ◙difficult moves.
00167
I'm getting very nervous. ◙What should I do if I can't ◙dance？ I hope everything ◙goes well...
00168
(It's unusual to see you ◙lacking confidence ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00169
○○○○○○○○
00170
How's your dancing team ◙doing？
00171
Manaka
00172
Eh？ Ah, you know...
00173
...？
00174
We had decided on the ◙choreography. Our dance ◙moves are better than other ◙groups.
00175
Uh-huh, I see.
00176
All the members have ◙memorized the moves by ◙now, but...
00177
...But？
00178
...Hey, do you think I have ◙bad sense of rhythm？
00179
Eh？ But you've played the ◙piano since you were a kid, ◙and you learned ballet too, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00180
Yeah, I know. That's also ◙what I thought...
00181
There must be something ◙wrong... Hmm...
00182
(Did she stumble during ◙the dance？ But that's kind ◙of surprising.)
00183
○○○○○○○○
00184
How did your dance practice ◙go, ▲MANAKA▲？
00185
Manaka
00186
Well, I'm not doing too ◙well... Everyone also said ◙that just a little bit more ◙and I could catch up.
00187
Okay.
00188
But, my team's turn is ◙during this coming week... ◙I...
00189
...▲MANAKA▲. ◙Are you free after this？
00190
Huh？ I'm thinking about ◙going home to practice the ◙dance moves.
00191
How about taking a break ◙today？ It's not good to ◙worry about it too much... ◙And I also want to be of ◙some help.
00192
You... You will teach me ◙how to dance？
00193
Yeah. If you can make a ◙joke like that, then you're ◙fine. Let's go have some ◙tea.
00194
I want to eat cake.
00195
Fine. I'll treat you this ◙time.
00196
Hehe. Yay！ ...Thanks. Now ◙I feel better.
00197
(At least, this is what I ◙can do to help you... ◙I'm rooting for you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00198
Manaka
00199
Hey, want to hear the ◙latest？
00200
○○○○○○○○
00201
What？
00202
I got full score for the ◙creative dance！
00203
Oh, you did it！
00204
Yeah, thanks to you. After ◙I spent some time with you, ◙I felt refreshed. And the ◙next day, my body simply ◙followed the rhythms.
00205
It reminded me of the first ◙time I rode a bicycle ◙without training wheels.
00206
Ah, I kind of understand ◙that feeling.
00207
Hehe... Hey, if you ever ◙feel stressed from ◙anything, tell me, okay？
00208
If it's something you can't ◙say, just lean on me. I'll ◙always be by your side.
00209
...I'm kidding！ Hey, this ◙time, let me treat you. ◙What do you want to eat？
00210
(Yay！)
00211
Manaka
00212
Say, have you heard about ◙a fortune teller in our ◙school whose predictions ◙are very accurate？
00213
○○○○○○○○
00214
A fortune teller？
00215
Yeah. Seems like you won't ◙be able to find out who ◙this person is unless you ◙are recommended by old ◙customers.
00216
Very high security, huh？
00217
Yeah.
00218
Are you interested in ◙fortune telling？
00219
Yeah, usually I read my ◙fortunes from a magazine, ◙but I've never seen a ◙fortune teller in person.
00220
Aren't you curious about ◙your fortune？
00221
Hmm, I don't know...
00222
Geez. Whatever. I'll ask ◙others about this then.
00223
(I wonder what do you want ◙to ask the fortune teller, ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00224
○○○○○○○○
00225
Have you learned anything ◙more about the fortune ◙teller？
00226
Manaka
00227
No, none of my classmates ◙has ever met that fortune ◙teller.
00228
But we've been talking ◙about it.
00229
I see. By the way, what do ◙you want to ask her, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00230
......
00231
Huh？
00232
Maybe I should stop.
00233
Huh？ Why？
00234
Everything is good now. ◙What if I were told that ◙the future would be bad...？
00235
Hmm, in that case... Hmm...
00236
(She seems to be rather ◙hesitant...)
00237
○○○○○○○○
00238
You gave up looking for the ◙fortune teller, right ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00239
Manaka
00240
...Yeah.
00241
Why was that？
00242
I gave up. Although I ◙already gave up...
00243
I finally got some leads ◙about that fortune teller.
00244
Haha... Maybe you can call ◙it fate, huh？
00245
...No, it's not.
00246
Huh...？
00247
...Um, actually, I kind of ◙wanted to...
00248
Haha, if you really want ◙to, just go for it.
00249
Um... Maybe. Hmm...
00250
(Why do you hesitate so ◙much like this？)
00251
○○○○○○○○
00252
Hey, have you met that ◙fortune teller yet？
00253
Manaka
00254
No, I think I will leave it ◙rest.
00255
I was just curious about my ◙future, but if it's about ◙my own future, I should be ◙the one to control it.
00256
Haha, that sounds more like ◙you, ▲MANAKA▲.
00257
Hehe, I'm just determined. ◙I'm kidding.
00258
By the way, who's this ◙fortune teller？
00259
It's the one at the ◙consultation room...
00260
...It's a secret.
00261
Eh？ Tell me.
00262
No, this is a secret among ◙girls.
00263
Okay, okay.
00264
Manaka
00265
Do you know where the most ◙famous spot in our school ◙is？
00266
○○○○○○○○
00267
Hmm... The rooftop？
00268
The rooftop ranks third.
00269
Then... where？
00270
The most famous one is the ◙courtyard.
00271
Who told you？
00272
The newspaper club did a ◙survey. They were searching ◙for the best spot for a nap.
00273
But they didn't share much ◙info about the exact spot ◙because it would be bad if ◙that spot became too famous.
00274
Now I feel like I want to ◙look for that spot, too.
00275
Really？ How about we both ◙secretly search for it？
00276
Yeah, let's do that, Holmes.
00277
Okay, Watson. Hehe！
00278
○○○○○○○○
00279
We really can't find the ◙best spot for napping, huh？
00280
Manaka
00281
Yeah, now no one can take a ◙nap.
00282
Maybe since so many people ◙are searching around there, ◙it's hard to find a place ◙to take a nap.
00283
Well, I think that's a ◙possible reason.
00284
Say, did you remember ◙hearing people shout "If ◙Peter Piper picked a peck ◙of pickled peppers" on the ◙way here？ What was that？
00285
Wasn't that the drama club？ ◙It was just their vocal ◙exercises, I think.
00286
I see. So that place ◙wouldn't be fit for a ◙napping spot then.
00287
Hmm... I feel like we might ◙have overlooked something ◙important...
00288
If Holmes can't solve this ◙case, then...
00289
Watson, you have to help ◙me. Geez.
00290
...Okay, I'm sorry.
00291
Manaka
00292
Hey, I have an idea...
00293
○○○○○○○○
00294
Oh！ Go on, Holmes.
00295
Hehe. Just be quiet and ◙listen, Watson.
00296
The news article might be a ◙lie. There could be better ◙places for a nap. The ◙courtyard was just a decoy.
00297
Really？ You really did ◙some research, eh？
00298
Yeah, I heard about this ◙from someone in the drama ◙club.
00299
Ah, since they were doing ◙their exercises nearby. You ◙really are brilliant, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00300
...Sorry, but you got me ◙wrong.
00301
I went to ask them what ◙followed "If Peter Piper ◙picked a peck of pickled ◙peppers" and napping spots ◙randomly came up.
00302
Holmes...
00303
Hmm... The following part ◙is "Where's the peck of ◙pickled peppers Peter Piper ◙picked？" It's a nursery ◙rhyme, you know？
00304
(Hmm...？ Should I be ◙impressed by this？)
00305
Manaka
00306
We really can't find the ◙napping spot.
00307
○○○○○○○○
00308
Yeah, if the newspaper club ◙didn't publish that ◙article, it wouldn't have ◙caused this much uproar.
00309
Hehe. It has become the ◙talk of the town, huh？ ◙...But it's too bad.
00310
I want to be there with you.
00311
Really？
00312
Yeah, if we could find a ◙quiet spot at school, we ◙could relax there. But ◙there's no such spot.
00313
It would be nice if we ◙could lie down on the ◙ground whenever we wanted.
00314
Yeah, that would be nice...
00315
But it was fun, so it's not ◙too bad. I now understand ◙Holmes' feelings a bit ◙better. Nice job, Watson. ◙I'll be counting on you.
00316
Yeah, sure thing, Holmes.
00317
...Teeheehee！
00318
Hahaha...
00319
Manaka
00320
Have you noticed that the ◙clock in our gym is really ◙behind？
00321
○○○○○○○○
00322
Ah, I heard that no one ◙gives it a tune-up. That's ◙why it's behind.
00323
Well, it's not that no one ◙adjusts it...
00324
What do you mean？
00325
Someone fixed it, but it ◙slowed down again.
00326
T-That's...
00327
It's troublesome that they ◙can't find the reason, ◙right？ This must be bad for ◙people in sports clubs.
00328
But why can't it be fixed？ ◙...This is mysterious.
00329
(Will this become part of ◙our school's seven wonders ◙or that sort of thing？)
00330
○○○○○○○○
00331
I heard that they were ◙trying to repair the clock ◙at the gym.
00332
Manaka
00333
Ah, right. Now, I feel ◙relieved.
00334
But what if it's beyond ◙repair？
00335
In that case, they can buy ◙a new one, right？
00336
...Hmm.
00337
What？
00338
Can't you act a little more ◙scared when I talk about ◙something scary...？
00339
......
00340
Ah~~！ It's scary~~！
00341
...S-Something like that？
00342
...I think that's enough.
00343
(That "Ah~~！" she just ◙made was priceless！)
00344
Manaka
00345
Say, have you heard about ◙that clock？
00346
○○○○○○○○
00347
Yeah. They were trying to ◙repair it again.
00348
But didn't they say that ◙it was beyond repair？
00349
In that case, it could ◙become "that thing", right？
00350
Then it could become a ◙haunted clock, or something ◙like that... I guess I've ◙heard about that...
00351
...As I thought. You're ◙not scared at all.
00352
Ah！！ I told you I would ◙not do that anymore.
00353
But...
00354
...If you show me how to ◙do that first, I'll follow ◙you.
00355
Me！？ Okay... A-Ah~~！ It's ◙scary~~！ How's that！？
00356
...I won't do it after all.
00357
What！？
00358
Manaka
00359
They finally removed that ◙clock.
00360
○○○○○○○○
00361
It ended just like that...
00362
They will install a new ◙clock. This time we will ◙see if something happens.
00363
If it delays again, this ◙will become a real scary ◙story.
00364
I hope it delays.
00365
......
00366
...Just kidding.
00367
...Geez.
00368
○○○○○○○○
00369
Have you heard that there ◙is some treasure buried ◙somewhere in our school, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00370
Manaka
00371
Buried treasure？ Haha, did ◙someone try to spread a ◙joke？
00372
That was what I thought, ◙but it has become a ◙widespread rumor recently.
00373
I wonder who started the ◙rumor.
00374
The person who did this ◙might have an ulterior ◙motive behind it.
00375
...？
00376
Like, using treasure ◙hunting to make people ◙become greedy. Someone ◙might gain something from ◙this, don't you think？
00377
Haha, don't tell me...
00378
I'm looking forward to ◙your follow-up report.
00379
(No way. Is she really ◙taking it seriously？)
00380
Manaka
00381
Did you find more info ◙about the buried treasure？
00382
○○○○○○○○
00383
Yeah, now more people are ◙starting to talk about ◙trying to dig for it.
00384
Even the teaching staff got ◙interested in this, too.
00385
Ahem...
00386
Oh！ It's the Great ◙Detective Takane's turn.
00387
Hehe. Have you considered ◙anyone who might want the ◙ground in the school dug？
00388
Could it be...
00389
In this case, people will ◙be tricked into digging the ◙school grounds for free.
00390
Will they find ghosts, or ◙snakes...？ Hehe, I can't ◙wait to see how it turns ◙out.
00391
(She's so into her mystery ◙novel character...)
00392
○○○○○○○○
00393
Wanna hear about the buried ◙treasure？
00394
Manaka
00395
Any progress？
00396
At last, even the alumni ◙heard about it and started ◙coming to school. The rumor ◙has really spread far.
00397
I see...
00398
Huh？
00399
If it's something even the ◙alumni would pay attention ◙to, it might be something ◙like...
00400
Like what？
00401
A time capsule. Finding ◙the one you buried must be ◙quite a tough job.
00402
Ah, you're right！
00403
But if that's not the case, ◙I doubt who spread the ◙rumor about buried ◙treasure...
00404
If we could only find the ◙rumor's source...
00405
○○○○○○○○
00406
Have you heard that the ◙mystery about the buried ◙treasure had been solved？
00407
Manaka
00408
Really？ What happened in ◙the end？
00409
The rumor started from a ◙treasure map that a ◙grade-schooler drew.
00410
A grade-schooler？
00411
Yeah, he's the brother of ◙a student here. That kid ◙showed his drawing to his ◙older brother and his ◙brother made up the joke.
00412
People would have noticed ◙immediately that it was a ◙fake treasure map...
00413
But the paper he used was ◙some old paper from the Edo ◙period, so it looked real.
00414
Haha, so that's how it was.
00415
Well, although it ended up ◙like that, some alumni ◙really did find the time ◙capsules they buried.
00416
Hehe, I could say that it ◙was just as what I ◙predicted.
00417
Yeah, you were right.
00418
Hehe, if there's something ◙like this again, let's try ◙to solve it. It's fun▼
00419
Manaka
00420
There's a new transfer ◙student in my class...
00421
○○○○○○○○
00422
Eh？ Could it be a girl？
00423
...You shouldn't be ◙concerned about that.
00424
I was joking. And？
00425
Geez... And although she's ◙a nice girl, she really ◙loves competitions.
00426
According to her, I am her ◙rival.
00427
...What does that mean？
00428
In the classroom, if I ◙raised my hand, she also ◙raised hers. During P.E. ◙class, she declared that ◙she wouldn't lose to me.
00429
Hmm... That's interesting.
00430
Yeah, it's fun. I'll have ◙to think how I should deal ◙with her. Now, I feel like ◙the atmosphere in my class ◙has become more cheerful.
00431
(Hmm, it seems to be fun.)
00432
○○○○○○○○
00433
How's everything going ◙with your rival？
00434
Manaka
00435
Hehe. There was a contest ◙to find who could buy a ◙tonkatsu sandwich, and she ◙tried to compete with other ◙guys in my class.
00436
Hahaha, and what was the ◙result？
00437
She was really upset ◙because she couldn't buy ◙any. That tonkatsu sandwich ◙sure is popular.
00438
I heard. I also want to ◙try one.
00439
You want to, huh？ ...Ah.
00440
What？
00441
Next time, I'll join the ◙contest. If I can get one, ◙I'll share it with you.
00442
You will join the contest ◙▲MANAKA▲！？
00443
Yeah, I don't think it's ◙good to run in the halls, ◙but if it's just once, it ◙should be fine.
00444
I have no choice. It will ◙be my first time running ◙down the hallway. Now, I'm ◙quite nervous...
00445
(You will be running down ◙the hallway... The whole ◙school will be surprised ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00446
○○○○○○○○
00447
By the way, how was the ◙tonkatsu sandwich？ Did your ◙rival get to buy one？
00448
Manaka
00449
In the end, the contest ◙was canceled.
00450
So she gave up already？
00451
No, but this time, she's ◙trying to find out the ◙shopkeeper's weakness ◙instead.
00452
...So, it turned out that ◙way, huh？
00453
Hehe, she's so persistent, ◙right？ I'll have to learn ◙from her, too.
00454
I think you are already a ◙very persistent person, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00455
Really？ But I don't think ◙I'm as persistent as her.
00456
Ah, I wonder if I can also ◙find a way to get that ◙tonkatsu sandwich.
00457
(Hmm, that girl influenced ◙you a great deal ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00458
○○○○○○○○
00459
Did you find the ◙shopkeeper's weakness？
00460
Manaka
00461
Hehe, of course not. So, we ◙decided to try to make the ◙sandwich by ourselves ◙instead.
00462
Haha, it sure is easier ◙that way. So, this is the ◙outcome of the contest, ◙huh？
00463
Not the outcome. Now, it ◙turned out to be a ◙competition.
00464
A competition？
00465
Yeah, we'll see who makes ◙a tonkatsu sandwich that ◙tastes closest to the ◙original.
00466
That sounds unreasonable...
00467
Hehe, but I don't think ◙I'll lose to her.
00468
Is that so？ How have you ◙two done in the ◙competitions so far？
00469
Of course, I won all of ◙them. I won, and I'll ◙always win. I'm kidding.
00470
(If they continue to do ◙this, will they become ◙eternal rivals？)
00471
Manaka
00472
You know Mori-sensei, the ◙history teacher, right？
00473
○○○○○○○○
00474
Ah, that old teacher.
00475
Hehe, so you know him. He's ◙going to retire soon.
00476
Really...？
00477
It's sad.
00478
Do you enjoy Mori-sensei's ◙class？
00479
Yes, very much. The way he ◙talks is so gentle and he ◙knows his subject so well.
00480
The way he talks is so ◙gentle that a lot of ◙students fall asleep.
00481
Hehe, his tone of voice ◙must make them feel at ◙peace.
00482
It's sad that he will leave ◙us soon...
00483
Yeah...
00484
○○○○○○○○
00485
Mori-sensei's retirement is ◙approaching...
00486
Manaka
00487
Yeah... I've been thinking ◙what I can do to repay him ◙for his kindness, but I ◙still have no idea.
00488
To repay his kindness...？ ◙For you, what you can do ◙best is to pay full ◙attention in his class, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00489
Hmm？ You say it like you ◙don't pay attention in his ◙class.
00490
No, no. I didn't mean that.
00491
Hehe, geez. But that might ◙be the only thing I can do.
00492
I should convince everyone ◙in my class to do so.
00493
Ah, that might be good.
00494
Okay, I'll try. Thanks for ◙your nice idea.
00495
(I hope it turns out well.)
00496
○○○○○○○○
00497
Everything's been going ◙great during Mori-sensei's ◙class, huh？
00498
Manaka
00499
Yeah, everyone paid full ◙attention in his class.
00500
And not many students fell ◙asleep.
00501
Hehe, right. Even Mori- ◙sensei was surprised...
00502
He was, and he seemed happy.
00503
......
00504
▲MANAKA▲？
00505
No, it's nothing. I was ◙thinking that he's going to ◙leave us soon, and I ◙suddenly felt sad...
00506
There are still a lot of ◙things I want to discuss ◙with him...
00507
(▲MANAKA▲...)
00508
○○○○○○○○
00509
Finally, Mori-sensei has ◙left.
00510
Manaka
00511
Yeah. I gave him a letter...
00512
A letter？
00513
Yeah, to thank him for all ◙his hard work and to wish ◙him happiness... It sounds ◙funny, but I couldn't do ◙anything else.
00514
I see. He must've been ◙happy to receive that.
00515
Yeah, he seemed happy...
00516
He said "Takane-san is a ◙student that I'm proud to ◙have taught" and that made ◙me happy...
00517
▲MANAKA▲...
00518
Don't make that face. I ◙just feel a little bit ◙lonely. This isn't ◙something to feel sad ◙about...
00519
If there's a chance, we ◙should meet him again...
00520
Manaka
00521
Ah！
00522
○○○○○○○○
00523
What's wrong？
00524
What is that boy over there ◙carrying？
00525
Ah, that's a handheld game ◙console.
00526
I see... Is it okay to ◙bring something like that ◙to school？
00527
It will be confiscated if ◙the teacher sees it. Do you ◙mean you've see other ◙people carrying them？
00528
Yes, many of the girls in ◙my class have them.
00529
They said that the games ◙are very "moe." I wonder ◙what kind of games they're ◙playing.
00530
Yeah... I wonder what kind ◙of "moe" they meant...
00531
What kind？
00532
(How can I explain to her ◙what "moe" is...？)
00533
Manaka
00534
Hey, we talked about the ◙game consoles that many ◙girls here have, right？
00535
○○○○○○○○
00536
Yeah, we did.
00537
Say, when they said "moe," ◙they meant "cute.", right？
00538
Oh, so that's what they ◙meant.
00539
But, "moe" means something ◙more than just cute.
00540
When I told them I didn't ◙understand, they offered ◙to lend me the game. I ◙refused though, since I ◙don't own the console.
00541
Hey, are there other ways ◙to experience this "moe" ◙besides playing games？
00542
I can't think of other ◙ways right now.
00543
Hmm, somehow I really want ◙to know. I want to find out ◙what "moe" really is.
00544
(For you, I don't think you ◙would understand it even if ◙I tried to explain, ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00545
Manaka
00546
I think I'm starting to ◙understand what "moe" is.
00547
○○○○○○○○
00548
Did something happen？
00549
I just tried playing that ◙game for a little bit.
00550
For a little bit？
00551
My friend said that I ◙almost got all the ◙characters, which means I ◙had completed nearly all ◙the routes.
00552
I see. Hmm, I sense some ◙danger coming.
00553
Danger？
00554
Come on you get absorbed ◙into things very easily, ◙don't you, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00555
Are games like this highly ◙addictive？
00556
It depends, I think. ◙Anyway, don't get so ◙addicted to games that you ◙forget about me, okay？
00557
As if that will ever ◙happen. Hehe.
00558
(...I hope this isn't the ◙Bad End flag for my love ◙life...)
00559
○○○○○○○○
00560
Hey, are you still playing ◙games？
00561
Manaka
00562
Well, the game console was ◙broken.
00563
That girl said that she ◙pushed it so hard that the ◙buttons stopped working.
00564
Such an intense player.
00565
So, I'll have to wait for ◙another chance to learn ◙more about "moe."
00566
...Hmm...
00567
Huh？ What's wrong？
00568
I'm just thinking that the ◙flag has been removed.
00569
The flag？
00570
Ah, no, it's nothing. ◙That's disappointing, huh？
00571
No, it's okay. Hey, let's ◙think about where we should ◙go to for our next date.
00572
Manaka
00573
Hey, has the new music ◙teacher taught your class ◙yet？
00574
○○○○○○○○
00575
No, not yet. Did something ◙happen？
00576
Yeah, the music class has ◙become much more fun. We ◙had to do some warm-ups ◙before the chorus class.
00577
Warm-ups？
00578
Yeah, light exercises and ◙stretching.
00579
What would exercising do ◙with music？
00580
When you sing, you have to ◙use various muscles in your ◙body, so it's good to warm ◙up those muscles first.
00581
Really？
00582
The most enjoyable part ◙was the self-introduction. ◙You can look forward to ◙your first class with this ◙teacher.
00583
I still feel like laughing ◙just thinking about it... ◙Hahaha！
00584
(Hmm, now I'm getting ◙curious...)
00585
Manaka
00586
How was your music class？
00587
○○○○○○○○
00588
"If you don't eat well, you ◙can't sing！ Eat 'em up！" ◙That's what he said！
00589
Yeah！ He really doesn't ◙seem like a music teacher, ◙does he？
00590
He's more like a P.E. ◙teacher.
00591
But he was the first ◙teacher to tell me that ◙music is about enjoying the ◙notes. He really made me ◙feel at ease.
00592
He made you feel at ease？
00593
Yeah, because I don't like ◙to lose, I always put all ◙my effort into things I'm ◙doing.
00594
Maybe I can just have fun ◙during the music class. I ◙can't wait for the next ◙class！
00595
(▲MANAKA▲...)
00596
○○○○○○○○
00597
How's the music class going？
00598
Manaka
00599
Well, I was asked to play ◙the piano. But I can't look ◙at the music sheet.
00600
Will you be okay then？
00601
Yeah, I've heard the tune ◙so many times that I've ◙learned how to play it. ◙This is like a challenge ◙from the teacher.
00602
Hahaha, he really did it.
00603
Hehe... Hey, thanks for ◙always listening to me.
00604
Why did you say that all ◙of a sudden？
00605
Well, the first person to ◙tell me not to be too ◙serious was you.
00606
If it weren't for you, I ◙wouldn't be able to enjoy ◙music class like I do now. ◙That's why I thanked you.
00607
Okay, you're welcome. Good ◙luck for your recital.
00608
Yeah！
00609
○○○○○○○○
00610
How was your recital？
00611
Manaka
00612
Well, I could play the ◙song, but...
00613
But？
00614
I was told that I didn't ◙enjoy it enough.
00615
What？
00616
"You should improvise a ◙little more." he said. ◙Argh... That Kawai-sensei ◙really confuses me.
00617
He can outwit you, huh？
00618
Yeah. Next time, I'll play ◙more freely then.
00619
Yeah, just do it.
00620
Hehehe！ You must root for ◙me.
