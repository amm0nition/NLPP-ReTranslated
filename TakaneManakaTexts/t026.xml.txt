00000
○○○○○○○○
00001
Practice has been hard ◙lately...
00002
Manaka
00003
Hehe, you look sleepy.
00004
You are very energetic, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00005
Maybe because I'm more ◙experienced. I started ◙playing tennis much earlier ◙than you.
00006
That's true, but...
00007
Hey, could it be that you ◙lack physical strength...？
00008
Ah... That could be the ◙case.
00009
How about you try jogging ◙every day？
00010
I'd prefer to have some ◙more sleep...
00011
...Hmm, so you just want ◙to sleep. Now, I can't ◙think of other options.
00012
(What shall I do...？)
00013
Manaka
00014
Why don't you find a part- ◙time job ▲PLAYER▲？
00015
○○○○○○○○
00016
Huh？ Why are you saying ◙that all of a sudden？
00017
We were talking about ◙training, right？ I was ◙speaking about it with a ◙classmate and he told me ◙doing part-time jobs helped ◙him build stamina.
00018
What kind of part-time ◙jobs？
00019
Carrying raw materials at ◙construction sites. Also, ◙working as a delivery man.
00020
T-That's...
00021
Impossible for you？
00022
I guess...
00023
I see... Maybe training ◙regularly would be the ◙best option, huh？
00024
(Yeah, I'll do that！)
00025
Manaka
00026
I'm buying a new racket.
00027
○○○○○○○○
00028
Why？
00029
I've been using this one ◙for a long time... It's ◙getting worn out...
00030
I see... Are you sad？
00031
Yeah... I really like it, ◙so it's sad to have to ◙buy a replacement...
00032
Ah... But it doesn't mean ◙that you have to throw it ◙away once you get a new ◙one, right？
00033
Yeah.
00034
Then you don't have to ◙feel sad about it.
00035
Plus, you may be able to ◙find a new one that you ◙really like.
00036
...Yeah, you might be ◙right. Say, will you help ◙me shop for a new one？
00037
Yeah, sure. Just tell me ◙when you want to go.
00038
○○○○○○○○
00039
Well, have you decided？
00040
Manaka
00041
I think I'll buy a ◙replacement.
00042
Ah, for your favorite ◙racket？
00043
Yeah, I found a new one ◙that I feel comfortable ◙with. Thanks for giving ◙me advice.
00044
You're welcome. What will ◙you do with your old racket ◙then？
00045
I'll put it in my memory ◙box.
00046
Your memory box？ What is ◙in there？
00047
I've been putting a lot of ◙things in there since I was ◙in grade school. A mat that ◙I made, some stickers that ◙I collected...
00048
But, maybe I should just ◙leave the racket outside. ◙It's pretty heavy, so it's ◙suitable for swinging ◙practice.
00049
(You really take good care ◙of your stuff ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00050
Manaka
00051
I wonder if it's hard to ◙maintain good grades while ◙attending club activities.
00052
○○○○○○○○
00053
Why？
00054
A classmate of mine who's ◙in a different club said ◙that.
00055
When she gets tired from ◙club activities, she feels ◙too exhausted to study.
00056
Ah, that's true.
00057
Hey, do you think I don't ◙practice enough？
00058
What do you mean？
00059
Because I've never felt ◙exhausted to the point that ◙I couldn't study. Does that ◙mean I don't practice ◙enough？
00060
Maybe I should ask the ◙captain for personalized, ◙intensive training...
00061
(I think you already ◙practice very hard... ◙You're really amazing, ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00062
○○○○○○○○
00063
How's everything going ◙after you increased your ◙practice？
00064
Manaka
00065
Well, it was more tiring, ◙but not to the point that ◙I fell asleep once I got ◙home. I should extend my ◙practice time...
00066
No, no, no. Don't do that.
00067
Eh？ Why？
00068
You'll hurt yourself if ◙you practice too much！
00069
...Okay, but...
00070
Most importantly, you'll ◙have less time to spend ◙with me！
00071
......
00072
If you say so, I...
00073
Okay. I'll just practice ◙regularly.
00074
(...Phew.)
00075
Manaka
00076
Hey, have you heard？ Our ◙club is going to change ◙its uniform？
00077
○○○○○○○○
00078
Yeah, I've heard they ◙hired a famous designer ◙this time. I wonder if ◙it's true.
00079
Really？ That would be nice.
00080
Hmm？ Are you interested？
00081
Hehe, before, I probably ◙wouldn't have cared much.
00082
But now, if there will be ◙cute uniforms, I really ◙want to wear them.
00083
You would be happy for ◙that too, wouldn't you？ ◙...I'm kidding.
00084
I wonder if we can see ◙them anytime soon. I really ◙want to know more about ◙them！
00085
(When she says something ◙like that, even I feel a ◙little embarrassed, too.)
00086
○○○○○○○○
00087
I have new info about the ◙new uniforms.
00088
Manaka
00089
Eh？ What is it？
00090
The story itself was true, ◙but now people from other ◙clubs are asking, "Why just ◙the tennis club？"
00091
I see. Hah... That's too ◙bad. Really...
00092
By the way, I keep ◙forgetting to tell you.
00093
Hmm？ What？
00094
You are already very cute, ◙you know it right, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00095
...Hey, why do you say it ◙all of a sudden！？ Such bad ◙timing...！
00096
I don't care anymore！
00097
(Bad timing...？ Girls are ◙really hard to understand.)
00098
Manaka
00099
Earlier, while I was ◙shopping, I ran into a ◙girl who I always competed ◙with in tennis matches.
00100
○○○○○○○○
00101
Huh？ Did you get a chance ◙to talk with her？
00102
Yeah, she called out to me. ◙That girl is really good ◙at tennis. I was totally ◙beaten during my first ◙match with her.
00103
Eh！？ Did you really lose ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00104
I can laugh about it now, ◙but it was really hard for ◙me back then. Now, I still ◙regret it.
00105
Somehow, I think I can ◙understand that feeling...
00106
Hehe, we talked about the ◙strategies our schools ◙used for practice.
00107
She told me some very ◙useful techniques. I wonder ◙if I should inform our ◙captain.
00108
Oh, are you becoming a spy ◙now？
00109
Don't exaggerate... ◙Anyway, I'm not going to ◙lose when it comes to ◙information warfare. ◙Hehehe...
00110
(Don't tell me she's been ◙holding a grudge ever since ◙she lost to that girl.)
00111
○○○○○○○○
00112
Did you get any more info ◙from your rival？
00113
Manaka
00114
Y-Yeah, sort of...
00115
Huh？ What's with that ◙vagueness？
00116
We talked about tennis, ◙of course... But, we also ◙talked about other ◙things...
00117
Other things？
00118
Like... Our boyfriends...
00119
...About me？
00120
Yeah, she also has a ◙boyfriend, so we kind of ◙shared the information...
00121
I-I see... What kind of ◙information？
00122
That's... Well, a little ◙bit of this, and a little ◙bit of that... ◙Yeah, something of that ◙sort, okay？
00123
(A little bit of this, ◙and a little bit of ◙that...？)
00124
Manaka
00125
By the way, people have ◙been discussing tennis ◙terminology lately.
00126
○○○○○○○○
00127
Really？ What kind of ◙terminology？
00128
Well, like there are a lot ◙of people who say "single" ◙instead of "singles".
00129
Ah, people who don't have ◙an interest in tennis might ◙say it wrong.
00130
Yeah. Currently, there are ◙a lot of people who just ◙started playing tennis in ◙high school, so they didn't ◙learn the terms.
00131
It's a bit weird that you ◙have to add an "s" to the ◙word "single", right？
00132
And there are terms like ◙"service" and "love" in ◙English. Then there's also ◙the term "mizutori" in ◙Japanese.
00133
Huh？ Is "mizutori" also a ◙tennis term？
00134
Eh？ That's what I thought. ◙...Maybe I'm wrong. I'd ◙better research about this ◙and I'll let you know.
00135
(You really like doing ◙researching, huh, ◙▲MANAKA▲？)
00136
Manaka
00137
We were discussing the ◙term "mizutori," right？ ◙It didn't originate from ◙tennis though.
00138
○○○○○○○○
00139
Huh？ Really？
00140
The term we used in tennis ◙is different from the one ◙in religious ceremonies, ◙but somehow it's related ◙to Chinese feng shui.
00141
You really did some ◙research on this. Thanks ◙for your effort.
00142
Hehe, you're welcome.
00143
It won't be fun if I have ◙to remember all the terms...
00144
Hehe. But if you know these ◙terms, you'll have more ◙fun when you play tennis, ◙right？
00145
Maybe not.
00146
But aren't you curious ◙about these terms？
00147
Maybe.
00148
Which one is your answer？ ◙Hehe！
00149
Manaka
00150
Hey, can you come with me ◙to the sports shop later？
00151
○○○○○○○○
00152
Sure. What do you want to ◙buy？
00153
I'm thinking about buying ◙a new pair of shoes. The ◙current pair still works ◙great, but they're getting ◙worn out.
00154
It's probably time for me ◙to change my racket's ◙strings too.
00155
I see. Maybe I should ◙change mine as well...
00156
When was the last time you ◙changed them？
00157
...When was it？
00158
For now, you should be ◙changing them every three ◙months...
00159
...I've been using them ◙much longer than that.
00160
That's what I thought...
00161
But you're amazing. Even ◙with old strings, you can ◙still play really well. ◙I respect you. Really.
00162
(She respects me for such ◙a weird thing...)
00163
Manaka
00164
How is it？ Did you feel ◙any differences after ◙changing the racket's ◙strings？
00165
○○○○○○○○
00166
The feeling is totally ◙different, especially when ◙I hit the ball.
00167
Hehe, then that's good. ◙It's a bit worrisome when ◙you think about changing ◙them, right？
00168
Do you change them every 3 ◙months, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00169
I usually do that. But, it ◙depends. Sometimes I ◙change them when I feel ◙like they need to be ◙changed.
00170
For me, by the time I ◙think about changing them, ◙I've already passed the ◙recommended period.
00171
Hehe, geez. If you want to ◙win a tournament, you at ◙least need to have ◙standards, right？
00172
I see. So, while we go to ◙the same school, I'll ◙change at the same time as ◙you, ▲MANAKA▲.
00173
...While we go to the same ◙school？
00174
Haha, sorry. I mean, even ◙after we graduate, too.
00175
Well said. I'm kidding. ◙Hehe！
00176
Manaka
00177
By the way, there was an ◙old man watching us ◙practice. Did you notice？
00178
○○○○○○○○
00179
Ah, I did. That guy kept ◙smiling as he watched.
00180
I wonder if he knows ◙someone on our team. Maybe ◙his granddaughter.
00181
I think he was there to ◙watch you play, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00182
What？ Really？ Hmm, but I ◙can't recall ever meeting ◙him before...
00183
...Hehe.
00184
Huh？
00185
He was turning his head ◙left and right when he ◙looked at the ball. It was ◙like a cat watching its ◙toy.
00186
Ah, when you say that, I ◙can picture it.
00187
Right？ But I didn't notice ◙when he left though...
00188
(So she doesn't know him？ ◙I was wrong, huh？)
00189
○○○○○○○○
00190
By the way, you were ◙talking to that old man ◙during practice. Did you ◙know him？
00191
Manaka
00192
No. I thought he came to ◙watch me play, but it was ◙a misunderstanding.
00193
Misunderstanding？
00194
He has a granddaughter and ◙she plays tennis as well. ◙But when I asked him, it ◙turned out that she was ◙in another school.
00195
Haha, that old man must be ◙surprised then...
00196
But do you really look like ◙his granddaughter？ What ◙school does she go to, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00197
...I forgot.
00198
Huh？
00199
I already forgot, so you ◙can't go to see that ◙girl... No, don't even ◙think about seeing her. ◙Got it？
00200
(I can tell what's on your ◙mind some times, ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00201
...What's your answer？
00202
...Okay. I'm sorry.
00203
○○○○○○○○
00204
Do you think my skill will ◙improve if I practice with ◙a backboard？
00205
Manaka
00206
Of course. If you don't ◙see any improvement, that ◙means you probably did it ◙wrong.
00207
Urgh.
00208
Hehe. Currently, there are ◙a lot of Japanese tennis ◙players that become famous ◙overseas.
00209
Yeah, the youngest ◙professional player ever ◙is Japanese...
00210
Yeah. I heard that when he ◙was a child, he only ◙practiced with a backboard.
00211
Huh...？ Then it's probably ◙quite an effective method.
00212
I think so. You can check ◙your form and evaluate your ◙control while you're ◙practicing.
00213
But if you just practice ◙recklessly, your form ◙might even get worse, so ◙you need to be careful.
00214
...Practicing with a ◙backboard isn't as easy as ◙I thought.
00215
Right, you can't take it ◙too lightly.
00216
(I should try harder during ◙my next practice then.)
00217
Manaka
00218
How's your practice with a ◙backboard going？
00219
○○○○○○○○
00220
Hmm, it's pretty fun. It's ◙such a simple practice.
00221
Hehe, you only need a ◙backboard in order to ◙practice, right？ Do you ◙see any improvement？
00222
I feel like my reflexes ◙are getting faster.
00223
I see, I see, anything ◙else？
00224
And... Ah, right. I was ◙wondering if you could take ◙a look at my form and give ◙me your opinion.
00225
Sure, it's okay. Maybe I ◙should try practicing with ◙a backboard with you, too.
00226
Ah, that sounds nice. ◙We'll have a date while ◙practicing together.
00227
Do you want to practice or ◙go on a date？
00228
Can I do both？
00229
Geez, that's too greedy. ◙Teeheehee！
00230
Manaka
00231
By the way, have you heard ◙about the tournament trip？
00232
○○○○○○○○
00233
Yeah, I've heard about it. ◙I wonder if the venue is ◙far from here.
00234
Maybe we have to go by bus. ◙It's very likely, right？
00235
I guess so. Eh？ You don't ◙like traveling by bus？
00236
Um, I don't usually get ◙carsick, but I'm not quite ◙comfortable with ◙sightseeing buses.
00237
You can easily get sick in ◙a sightseeing bus, huh？ ◙Maybe you should take some ◙medicine to prevent motion ◙sickness in advance.
00238
......
00239
Eh？ You can't take motion ◙sickness medicine？
00240
No, that's not the case... ◙But I'll get drowsy if I ◙take the medicine. I'll ◙just sleep through the ◙whole trip.
00241
Hah, what should I do？ ◙Will I be allowed to go by ◙train by myself？
00242
(This is a tough situation. ◙...I don't know what I can ◙do.)
00243
○○○○○○○○
00244
By the way, we're only ◙going to the nearby town ◙for the tournament trip.
00245
Manaka
00246
Yeah, we'll go by train so ◙I'm quite relieved now. ◙But... I really have to be ◙well prepared.
00247
Right. And there might be ◙a real trip sometime later.
00248
Um... What do you think I ◙should do？
00249
I've done some research. ◙Sitting near the front of ◙the bus, not looking around ◙too much, and wearing ◙sunglasses help.
00250
Really？
00251
Yeah, avoid anything ◙that'll stimulate your ◙vision. You can try to ◙look straight as if you ◙were a bus driver too.
00252
Look straight as if I were ◙a bus driver？ Maybe I can ◙practice doing that with ◙arcade games first.
00253
Ah, with car-racing games？ ◙I wonder...
00254
I should give it a try. ◙Hey, will you accompany me ◙there？
00255
U-Um, okay.
00256
All right. I'll try to ◙win...！
00257
(If she can overcome her ◙motion sickness by playing ◙games, it'll be such an ◙amazing discovery...)
00258
○○○○○○○○
00259
By the way, do members of ◙the female tennis club ◙quarrel sometimes？
00260
Manaka
00261
Well... There were two ◙girls who used to be very ◙good friends. They always ◙practiced together.
00262
But then they fell in love ◙with the same guy and ◙started to quarrel.
00263
I see...
00264
...If you were the guy ◙they fell in love with, I ◙would probably be like ◙those girls.
00265
Eh！？
00266
Earlier, I couldn't ◙understand why people ◙would fight over something ◙like that...
00267
But now, I think I know ◙how they feel when they ◙think the guy they love ◙might be snatched away.
00268
▲MANAKA▲...
00269
I still want them to be ◙friends again, but it might ◙be quite difficult.
00270
...For me to finally ◙understand something like ◙that, love sure is an ◙amazing thing.
00271
(Don't make that sad face.)
00272
○○○○○○○○
00273
...Hey, what happened to ◙the girls that were ◙fighting？
00274
Manaka
00275
Oh, they reconciled.
00276
So fast！ How？
00277
They both confessed to ◙him, and they both were ◙rejected. They realized ◙that neither of them could ◙get him...
00278
So, they finally decided ◙to become friends again.
00279
R-Really？ Trying to ◙understand a girl's ◙feelings is tough...
00280
Hehe. Now they are friends ◙again. I'm glad my ◙intuition was wrong this ◙time.
00281
▲MANAKA▲...
00282
Sorry. I said something ◙weird earlier. I hope ◙you'll just forget it.
00283
...It's okay. Don't worry ◙about it.
00284
Thanks. Then let's move on.
00285
(I don't want to see you ◙making that sad face again ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00286
○○○○○○○○
00287
Have you heard about our ◙advisor, Suzuki-sensei？ ◙His wife will give birth ◙to a baby soon.
00288
Manaka
00289
Yeah！ He's been very ◙fidgety lately. I finally ◙understood why when I ◙heard the news.
00290
Hahaha. He really has been ◙absent-minded lately.
00291
Hehe. Right now, we have ◙a plan to give him a ◙surprise present.
00292
Hmm？ That sounds fun.
00293
Right？ Maybe the male ◙members should join us ◙too.
00294
Then I'll ask the captain ◙about this.
00295
Okay, I'll leave it to you.
00296
Wow, maybe Suzuki-sensei ◙will be impressed and cry.
00297
He is strict sometimes, ◙but he has his sensitive ◙side. I can't wait to see ◙how he will react.
00298
○○○○○○○○
00299
By the way, Suzuki-sensei ◙really cried, huh？
00300
Manaka
00301
Yeah, I even cried with ◙him.
00302
Some guys in our club ◙cried too.
00303
You're saying that, but ◙what about you？
00304
Huh？ What do you mean？
00305
Hehe, it's okay. I'd better ◙not ask.
00306
But it'd be nice to have ◙a husband like him... ◙One day, we'll also...
00307
Huh？
00308
Nothing！ I was thinking ◙that we gave him the ◙present before practice, ◙yet the practice was so ◙hard.
00309
Yeah, he reacted by being ◙even more strict with us.
00310
Hehe！ We can't lose to his ◙happiness. Let's do our ◙best too.
00311
Okay！
