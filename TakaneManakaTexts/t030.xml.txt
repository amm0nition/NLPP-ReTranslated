Manaka
00001
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ◙ask you a question？
00002
○○○○○○○○
00003
Yes, go ahead.
00004
I'm thinking about buying ◙new clothes. I'll need ◙your opinion.
00005
My opinion for clothes...？ ◙Hmm... Let me see...
00006
Simple, I guess
00007
▲MANAKA▲, cute！
00008
Neat and tidy
00009
Try something different...
00010
Current clothes are nice
00011
I like simple clothes. A ◙casual style is okay.
00012
I don't think that style ◙will suit me though.
00013
But if the wearer is too ◙pretty, something simple ◙will make the overall look ◙more balanced！
00014
Hey, I was asking you ◙seriously... So, casual ◙style, eh？
00015
(I think a casual style ◙will be really nice. Yeah.)
00016
Cute is good！
00017
Hmm... I see.
00018
...？
00019
I know I'm just not cute.
00020
No, no！ Come on. Something ◙fluttery and fluffy will ◙suit you best, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00021
Like something with frills, ◙or laces, or sheer muslins？
00022
I guess.
00023
Wouldn't that make me look ◙too childish？
00024
No！ I'm sure you'll look ◙cute！
00025
O-Okay. Thanks. But, hmm...
00026
(A cute style is best for ◙▲MANAKA▲！)
00027
Surely, a tidy, neat, ◙lady-like style would suit ◙▲MANAKA▲ best.
00028
I don't think I look like a ◙lady or anything like that.
00029
Sorry, but I think you look ◙best with a graceful style◙▲MANAKA▲.
00030
Is that so？ Hmm...
00031
(Of course. For me, a ◙graceful style suits ◙▲MANAKA▲ best！)
00032
Occasionally, it should be ◙something like...
00033
Like what？
00034
Something with a little ◙less fabric... Yeah.
00035
Like mini-skirts or ◙something of that sort？
00036
S-Sort of. They make you ◙look active！
00037
Hmm？ Mini-skirts are ◙active, huh？
00038
They are, right？ And you ◙can help protect the ◙environment too.
00039
Don't get ahead of ◙yourself... Pervert.
00040
I'm sorry...
00041
Of course, from a ◙boyfriend's point of view, ◙the style you're wearing ◙now looks good.
00042
Really？ Hmm, then from a ◙girlfriend's point of view, ◙I think I'll keep wearing ◙this style. Hehe▼
00043
Manaka
00044
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00045
○○○○○○○○
00046
Yes, go ahead.
00047
I'm going to buy some new ◙clothes and I wonder what ◙style you prefer.
00048
Your clothes...？ Hmm, ◙well...
00049
Simple, I guess
00050
▲MANAKA▲, cute！
00051
Neat and tidy
00052
Try something different...
00053
Current clothes are nice.
00054
I like simple clothes. A ◙casual style is okay.
00055
Um, I understand... But for ◙a plain girl like me, won't ◙that make me look even more ◙plain？
00056
You think you're a plain ◙girl！？ That's not true ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00057
Really？
00058
Really. And don't try to ◙say something like that to ◙your friends either.
00059
Huh...？ Why？
00060
(People might take it as ◙sarcasm...)
00061
Cute is good！
00062
Cute？
00063
Come on, you've worn that ◙style even before we ◙started dating.
00064
Ah, that's... true. But, ◙don't you think I look ◙childish like that？
00065
Not at all. For me, the you ◙that I know is always the ◙one that I love, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00066
Um... Since you said so, ◙I'll keep wearing this ◙style.
00067
(Did that sound a little ◙pretentious？ But I really ◙think you looks best with ◙cute outfits, ◙▲MANAKA▲！)
00068
Of course, a neat style ◙that makes you look like ◙a lady will suit you best, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00069
I'm not a lady or anything ◙like that...
00070
Really？ But, I really ◙think a graceful style ◙would suit you best, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00071
Do you... think so...？ If ◙you say so, it might really ◙suit me...
00072
(Yeah, neat clothes suit ◙▲MANAKA▲ best！)
00073
Occasionally, you should ◙try... Hmm... How can I ◙say this？ Something that ◙doesn't waste so much ◙material.
00074
...？
00075
Um... Some outfits that are ◙kind of small and tight...
00076
You mean... something like ◙a mini-skirt？
00077
Well, that's one example.
00078
Hmm...
00079
Is it a style you don't ◙want to wear？
00080
It's not that I don't want ◙to wear... but you have to ◙promise that you won't look ◙at me with your perverted ◙eyes.
00081
I promise！！
00082
Geez...
00083
Hooray~！！
00084
Of course, from a ◙boyfriend's point of view, ◙the style you're wearing ◙now looks good.
00085
...Um, okay. That's good ◙then. Hehe▼
00086
Manaka
00087
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00088
○○○○○○○○
00089
Yes, go ahead.
00090
I'm thinking about buying ◙some new clothes. Do you ◙have any requests？
00091
My opinion for clothes...？ ◙Hmm... Let me see...
00092
Simple, I guess
00093
▲MANAKA▲, cute！
00094
Neat and tidy
00095
Try something different...
00096
Current clothes are nice
00097
Something refreshing like a ◙casual style will be nice.
00098
Casual？ Why？
00099
Somehow, they'll make you ◙look active. I think that ◙style suits you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00100
I've also wanted to try ◙wearing that style. Don't ◙be disappointed if it ◙doesn't suit me, okay？
00101
I won't！ I'm sure it'll ◙suit you ◙▲MANAKA▲！
00102
Hehe, then I'll take the ◙challenge.
00103
(A casual style is best ◙for her. I'll have to pay ◙attention to my clothes, ◙too.)
00104
Cute ones would be nice. ◙A cute style suits you ◙nicely, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00105
Really？
00106
Around the time we first ◙met, you always wore cute ◙outfits, right ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00107
Yeah, I know. But I think I ◙look childish in them, so ◙I've been wondering if ◙you'd like a different ◙style.
00108
You always look good in ◙everything. But I think a ◙cute style suits you best, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00109
Thanks, I'm glad you said ◙that.
00110
(Yeah, you look best with ◙cute outfits, ◙▲MANAKA▲！)
00111
Something neat and a bit ◙elegant would be nice.
00112
Elegant...？ Hmm...
00113
For a man, an elegant style ◙is somewhat ideal, you ◙know？
00114
I see... But... Will that ◙style suit me？
00115
It will suit you！ I'm ◙quite sure.
00116
Hm, then I'll try it. Hehe▼
00117
(Yeah, you would look good ◙with an elegant style, ◙▲MANAKA▲！)
00118
Occasionally, you should ◙take a challenge and try ◙something that makes you ◙look more mature, right？
00119
Mature？ You mean like ◙something college students ◙would wear？
00120
Something like that... I ◙mean, something small that ◙fits you tightly...
00121
Something like... a very ◙short mini-skirt, or a ◙shirt that shows my belly ◙button？
00122
Yeah, something like that ◙would be nice.
00123
But that's quite ◙embarrassing... Do you ◙think I should try that？
00124
Yeah... You don't want to？
00125
Geez... I'll try to take ◙the challenge.
00126
(Hooray to the challenge！！)
00127
Actually, your current ◙style is very nice. I think ◙you look great, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00128
...Really？
00129
Really. You already look ◙great like this, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00130
Okay▼
00131
Manaka
00132
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00133
○○○○○○○○
00134
Yes, go ahead.
00135
I'm thinking about changing ◙my hairstyle. What do you ◙think？
00136
Hairstyle...？ Hmm, well...
00137
Long, ▲MANAKA▲！
00138
Short is nice
00139
Not long, nor short...
00140
Current length is good.
00141
Long hair suits you best, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00142
Really？ Hmm... I guess you ◙might be right.
00143
Your image suits a heroine ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00144
Really？
00145
Yes, and the heroine is ◙obligated to have long, ◙silky hair.
00146
That sounds weird. But... ◙Okay, I think long hair's ◙good then.
00147
(Of course, for you, long ◙hair suits you the best, ◙▲MANAKA▲！)
00148
Short is nice！
00149
Really？ Why？
00150
Why？ It gives a lively, ◙open-minded, and friendly ◙image. Also, it's a nice ◙choice for an image change.
00151
I see.
00152
But... Hmm...
00153
What？
00154
So you're saying I'm dull, ◙narrow-minded, and ◙unfriendly then？
00155
(I made her angry... But I ◙really like short hair！)
00156
Let me see... Semi-long, I ◙guess.
00157
You like semi-long hair？ ◙Why？
00158
Short hair is nice but long ◙hair also suits you well. ◙So I chose the middle path, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00159
Hey... You should think ◙about it more seriously.
00160
But, in a way, I can do a ◙lot of styles with that ◙length... I guess it's good.
00161
(Not too long, not too ◙short. Semi-long is great！)
00162
The current length is good. ◙I like you with this ◙hairstyle, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00163
Hmm...？ I see. I'll keep it ◙like this for you then.
00164
Manaka
00165
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00166
○○○○○○○○
00167
Yes, go ahead.
00168
I'm thinking about changing ◙my hairstyle. What do you ◙think？
00169
Hairstyle...？ Hmm, well...
00170
Long, ▲MANAKA▲！
00171
Short is nice
00172
Semi-long, I guess
00173
Current length is good.
00174
Your look goes best with ◙long hair, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00175
I see... Why is that？
00176
Because that was what left ◙a big impression on me when ◙I first met you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00177
Hmm？ What kind of ◙impression？
00178
Your long hair was swaying ◙sparklingly, and I thought, ◙"Wow, so beautiful."
00179
......
00180
I also like long hair. I'm ◙very glad to hear you say ◙that.
00181
(You look best with long ◙hair. Yeah, ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00182
Short is nice！-
00183
Short？ Really？
00184
The "pretty" image is nice, ◙but your "cute" image is ◙obvious, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00185
That depends on individual ◙taste. Are you saying that ◙because we've been hanging ◙out often？
00186
Maybe. But I think everyone ◙who looks at you would say ◙that you are cute！
00187
Well, for me, I only need ◙to hear that from you. Oh ◙well...
00188
(Yay！ Go with short！)
00189
Well, I think, semi-long.
00190
Semi-long？
00191
Short is nice, but I want ◙you to have long hair. ◙Sorry. It's just my guy's ◙ego, I guess, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00192
You don't have to apologize ◙for that...
00193
I really like it when you ◙tell me what you think. ◙Just this is enough to ◙make me love you, I'm ◙kidding...
00194
(You are just so cute ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00195
I like your current ◙hairstyle, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00196
Okay. I was just thinking ◙that you might get bored ◙of it... I'll keep it like ◙this then.
00197
Manaka
00198
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00199
○○○○○○○○
00200
Yes, go ahead.
00201
Well, I'm thinking about ◙changing my hairstyle. Do ◙you have any requests？
00202
Hairstyle...？ Hmm, well...
00203
Long, ▲MANAKA▲！
00204
Short is nice
00205
Not long, nor short...
00206
Current length is good.
00207
I like you with long hair ◙the best, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00208
I see. Hmm... Why？
00209
When we first met, ◙you had long hair, right ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00210
Yeah. I've always had long ◙hair.
00211
Your long hair was swaying ◙sparklingly, and I thought, ◙"Wow, so beautiful."
00212
Hey... You only say things ◙like this. But I'm happy.
00213
(You look best with long ◙hair. Yeah, ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00214
Short is nice！
00215
Short？ I see... Why？
00216
People usually look at you ◙and think you are a lady of ◙a high-class family, right ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00217
That's... Yeah, I guess ◙they do.
00218
But you actually are a ◙sociable and lively girl. ◙So, short hair is more ◙suitable for you.
00219
...Thank you. I'm really ◙happy to hear you say that. ◙I want to be a girl like ◙what you described.
00220
Okay. Then I'll take this ◙short hair challenge！
00221
(Yay！ Short hair！)
00222
Well, I think, semi-long.
00223
Semi-long？
00224
Short is good and long ◙makes you look more like ◙"THE ▲MANAKA▲." ◙I can't choose one over ◙the other...
00225
So you chose semi-long？ ◙Hehe, you're so weird.
00226
Really？ But we got a ◙solution for it already, ◙right？
00227
Yes. Then I'll go with it. ◙Hehe▼
00228
(I can't wait to see you ◙with a semi-long hairstyle ◙▲MANAKA▲！)
00229
I like your current ◙hairstyle, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00230
...Really？
00231
Really.
00232
Then I'll keep it like this ◙because you said you "like" ◙it. Yeah... Hehe▼
00233
Manaka
00234
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00235
○○○○○○○○
00236
Yes, go ahead.
00237
Hey, what's your favorite ◙food？ I just want to make ◙sure...
00238
My favorite food...？ ◙Lately, I like...
00239
Potatoes！
00240
Japanese food
00241
Western food
00242
Chinese food
00243
I love sweet potatoes！ ◙You do too, right, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00244
Potatoes？ Um... Yeah, I ◙like them.
00245
Lately, I really enjoy ◙eating them. They're just ◙so delicious！
00246
They're delicious but how ◙could I prepare any potato ◙dishes...？ Um...
00247
What？
00248
No！ Never mind.
00249
(...？)
00250
I love Japanese food. I'm ◙Japanese, after all！
00251
Yay.
00252
Huh？
00253
Nothing！ I also love it. ◙Anything you dislike？
00254
Dislike？
00255
For example, some fish, or ◙some vegetable...
00256
Udon, soba, gyudon, ◙katsudon, tempura... Nope. ◙None at all！
00257
Eh？ So... any Japanese food ◙is fine for you then？
00258
Yeah, I just love Japanese ◙food！
00259
(Yeah... I'm proud to be ◙Japanese！)
00260
I guess I love Western ◙food. Ketchup and sauce are ◙famous for young people, ◙right！？
00261
Ketchup and sauce？ Like in ◙a Western-styled restaurant？
00262
Yeah, right！ I like omelet ◙rice and Neapolitan. ◙Something like that.
00263
How about hamburger and ◙curry？
00264
Yeah, I like those as well！
00265
Hehe. You're so cute▼
00266
I love Chinese food！ Like ◙stir-fried dishes that make ◙you go "haaaa" when you eat ◙them.
00267
So you like stir-fried ◙dishes？
00268
Sort of. They fill my ◙stomach very well.
00269
Hmm...
00270
You don't like Chinese ◙food, ▲MANAKA▲？
00271
No, I like it. But if it's ◙stir-fried, it will get ◙cold. Hmm...
00272
(It will get cold？)
00273
Manaka
00274
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00275
○○○○○○○○
00276
Yes, go ahead.
00277
If the two of us were to go ◙somewhere, where would you ◙want to go？
00278
Let me see...
00279
Calm and quiet places
00280
Anywhere I can exercise
00281
Fashionable places
00282
Anywhere I can play
00283
Calm and quiet places, I ◙guess.
00284
Somewhere quiet where you ◙can feel at ease or ◙something like that？
00285
Yeah. We would be able to ◙relax in a place like that, ◙right？
00286
Hehe. Quiet places, huh？ ◙I'll remember that.
00287
Anywhere I can exercise, I ◙guess.
00288
Hmm... Why？
00289
In such places, we can be ◙hyper without causing ◙troubles to others.
00290
Hehe, that's right.
00291
Okay, I got it. I'll ◙remember that.
00292
Fashionable places, I guess.
00293
Fashionable...
00294
Hmm？ What's wrong？
00295
I'm not quite comfortable ◙going to such places.
00296
But, I'll try. So, you like ◙fashionable places, huh？
00297
Anywhere I can play, I ◙guess.
00298
Your answer is pretty ◙vague, you know？
00299
Well, if you are with me, ◙where we go doesn't matter ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00300
Hey, I was asking you ◙seriously.
00301
Hehe. But, okay. I'll ◙remember that.
00302
Manaka
00303
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00304
○○○○○○○○
00305
Yes, go ahead.
00306
Hey, what kind of places ◙would you like to go when ◙you are with me？
00307
Let me see...
00308
Calm and quiet places
00309
Anywhere I can exercise
00310
Fashionable places
00311
Anywhere I can play
00312
Calm and quiet places, I ◙guess.
00313
Hehe. Somewhere we can ◙relax, right？
00314
Yeah. A place where I can ◙have some leisure time to ◙talk with you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00315
...Yeah. I think I like ◙those kinds of places, too.
00316
Calm and quiet places, huh？ ◙I'll keep that in mind...
00317
Anywhere I can exercise, I ◙guess.
00318
Those places make you feel ◙refreshed, right？
00319
Yeah, that's right！
00320
Hehe. I think I can ◙understand that kind of ◙feeling.
00321
Places where you can ◙exercise, eh？ I'll keep ◙that in mind...
00322
Fashionable places, I guess.
00323
Um... Like those date spots ◙that get featured in ◙magazines？
00324
Yeah, something like that.
00325
Hehe. It'd be fun to go ◙somewhere like that with ◙you.
00326
Fashionable places, huh？ ◙I'll keep that in mind...
00327
Anywhere I can play, I ◙guess.
00328
Places where you can play？
00329
Yeah, so that I can have ◙as much fun as I want with ◙you, ▲MANAKA▲.
00330
It must be fun to play ◙with you...
00331
Places where you can play, ◙huh？ I'll keep that in ◙mind...
00332
Manaka
00333
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00334
○○○○○○○○
00335
Yes, go ahead.
00336
Okay, here's the question. ◙Where would you like to go ◙for a date？
00337
Let me see...
00338
Calm and quiet places
00339
Anywhere I can exercise
00340
Fashionable places
00341
Anywhere I can play
00342
Calm and quiet places, I ◙guess.
00343
Hmm...Why？
00344
So that we can relax ◙together, right ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00345
You didn't have to ask me.
00346
Hehe, but I got it. Calm ◙and quiet places, huh？
00347
Anywhere I can exercise, I ◙guess.
00348
So we can have a match？
00349
Yeah, something like that. ◙Victory will be mine！
00350
Hehe, are you sure？ Don't ◙be so confident.
00351
But I got it. Places where ◙you can exercise, huh？
00352
Fashionable places, I guess.
00353
Like places that everyone ◙talks about？
00354
Yeah, it feels like we've ◙conquered something when we ◙go there.
00355
Hehe, I see. We can create ◙nice memories together...
00356
Okay, I got it. Fashionable ◙places, huh？
00357
Anywhere I can play, I ◙guess.
00358
You still haven't played ◙enough, huh？
00359
You played enough then, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00360
Hehe. Geez！ I didn't say ◙that, right？
00361
Places where you can play, ◙huh？ Got it▼
00362
Manaka
00363
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00364
○○○○○○○○
00365
Yes, go ahead.
00366
Hey, when you go out alone, ◙what kind of places do you ◙like to go to？
00367
When I go out alone...？
00368
Calm and quiet places
00369
Anywhere I can exercise
00370
Fashionable places
00371
Anywhere I can play
00372
Calm and quiet places, I ◙guess.
00373
Hmm？ So, you can't enjoy ◙your quiet time when you're ◙with me then？
00374
Eh！？
00375
Hehe, just kidding. Don't ◙panic！
00376
Calm and quiet places, huh？
00377
Anywhere I can exercise, I ◙guess.
00378
Hmm？ You like to relieve ◙your stress that way？
00379
Nah, I'm not really a ◙stressed person.
00380
Hehe, I see.
00381
So, you like places where ◙you can exercise. Okay.
00382
Fashionable places, I guess.
00383
...You go to those places ◙alone？
00384
Yeah, I need to do some ◙research sometimes.
00385
Hmm... That's fine then.
00386
Fashionable places... I got ◙it.
00387
Anywhere I can play, I ◙guess.
00388
So you like to play by ◙yourself...
00389
▲MANAKA▲？ ◙What's wrong？
00390
No, never mind.
00391
Places where you can play, ◙hmm...
00392
Manaka
00393
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00394
○○○○○○○○
00395
Yes, go ahead.
00396
What kind of places do you ◙like to go to when you go ◙out alone？
00397
Let me see...
00398
Calm and quiet places
00399
Anywhere I can exercise
00400
Fashionable places
00401
Anywhere I can play
00402
Calm and quiet places, I ◙guess.
00403
I see... You also need ◙some quiet time, right？
00404
Right. Sometimes I need to ◙take a breather.
00405
Hehe. That's good, huh？
00406
Calm and quiet places, hmm...
00407
Anywhere I can exercise, I ◙guess.
00408
You like to exercise alone？
00409
Yeah, I like to go for my ◙independent training.
00410
Hehe, you're really ◙energetic, huh？
00411
So you like places where ◙you can exercise, hmm...
00412
Fashionable places, I ◙guess.
00413
Don't you feel lonely when ◙you go to such places by ◙yourself？
00414
I'm okay. I go there to do ◙some research for our date ◙locations anyway.
00415
Really？ I'm happy...
00416
So... Fashionable places, ◙hmm.
00417
Anywhere I can play, I ◙guess.
00418
Wow... Playing makes you ◙feel refreshed, right？
00419
That's right. I highly ◙recommend it.
00420
I see. Maybe I'll try one ◙of those places when I ◙have a chance.
00421
Places where you can play, ◙hmm...
00422
Manaka
00423
▲PLAYER▲. Can I ask ◙you a question？
00424
○○○○○○○○
00425
Yes, go ahead.
00426
Hey, what kind of places ◙do you like to go to when ◙you go out alone？
00427
Let me see...
00428
Calm and quiet places
00429
Anywhere I can exercise
00430
Fashionable places
00431
Anywhere I can play
00432
Calm and quiet places, I ◙guess.
00433
Calm and quiet？
00434
Yeah. I need some time to ◙search for my inner self.
00435
Hehe, you said it so ◙casually like that.
00436
I see. You like calm and ◙quiet places then...
00437
Anywhere I can exercise, I ◙guess.
00438
If I can spend some time ◙exercising, I can sleep ◙like a log at night.
00439
Hmm...？ Maybe I should try ◙to disturb you while you ◙are asleep.
00440
Eh！？
00441
Hehe, just kidding. You ◙like places where you can ◙exercise then...
00442
Fashionable places, I ◙guess.
00443
Hmm？ Are you researching ◙date spots for us？
00444
Sort of.
00445
Hehe. I can have some ◙expectation for our next ◙date, then.
00446
Well... Fashionable places, ◙hmm...
00447
Anywhere I can play, I ◙guess.
00448
You don't mean playing in  ◙a perverted sense, right？
00449
O-Of course！
00450
Hehe. Of course, I'm just ◙kidding.
00451
Well, places where you can ◙exercise, hmm...
00452
Manaka
00453
Hey... What's your ◙favorite "type"？ I mean, ◙in regards to girls.
00454
○○○○○○○○
00455
My type？ Let me see... She ◙has to be...
00456
Kind and obedient
00457
Cheerful and positive
00458
You're my type ◙▲MANAKA▲
00459
Kind and obedient. Yeah...
00460
Kind and obedient, huh？ ◙Hmm, I see.
00461
▲MANAKA▲？
00462
I thought I've been kind ◙to you lately.
00463
But, you said...
00464
I said what？
00465
Nothing... Being kind is ◙quite difficult.
00466
(▲MANAKA▲...)
00467
Cheerful and positive.
00468
Cheerful and positive... I ◙see. Huh...
00469
Eh？ Did I say something ◙weird？
00470
Weird？ You're just fond of ◙cheerful and positive ◙girls, right？
00471
W-Well, that's right..... ◙Are you angry？
00472
I don't know.
00473
(She's angry...)
00474
She has to be like you ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00475
Ah！！ I didn't expect you ◙to say that...
00476
But I like you. That's why ◙I'm with you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00477
I see. Hmm...
00478
Eh？ Did I say something ◙weird？
00479
You did.
00480
Which part was weird？
00481
I don't know... Don't tease ◙me.
00482
(I think she's getting ◙embarrassed.)
00483
Manaka
00484
Hey, can you tell me what ◙type of girl you like？
00485
○○○○○○○○
00486
Yeah, sure. For me...
00487
Cool and calm
00488
Cheerful and positive
00489
You're my type ◙▲MANAKA▲
00490
Cool and calm, I guess
00491
Cool？ Like being cold？
00492
Well, kind of... And ◙like... intelligent and ◙mysterious.
00493
I see... I also think that ◙kind of girl is wonderful, ◙but...
00494
I just can't act coldly ◙toward you. Because for me, ◙you are...
00495
▲MANAKA▲...
00496
No. I got it. I'll try my ◙best！
00497
(...？)
00498
Cheerful and positive.
00499
Cheerful and positive... I ◙see... Um... But...
00500
Is that weird？
00501
No. But don't you think ◙that type of girl is a bit ◙disgraceful？
00502
Really？ Why？
00503
Why...？ Like if I try to ◙approach you...
00504
You're trying to approach ◙me, ▲MANAKA▲？
00505
...You're so mean.
00506
(？？？)
00507
She has to be just like ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00508
Hey... It was a serious ◙question.
00509
But I really like you. ◙That's why I'm with you ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00510
...Oh. Thank you.
00511
You're welcome.
00512
Hehe. Hey...
00513
Hmm？
00514
I love this gentle part of ◙you... Yeah.
00515
(I'm getting embarrassed...)
00516
Manaka
00517
Hey. Has your favorite ◙type changed since the last ◙time I asked？
00518
○○○○○○○○
00519
My type？ Let me see... She ◙has to be...
00520
Cool and calm
00521
Kind and obedient
00522
You're my type ◙▲MANAKA▲
00523
The cool and calm type, I ◙guess.
00524
Really！？
00525
Huh？ Did I say something ◙weird？
00526
That's not the case, but ◙because you... That's why ◙I...
00527
...？
00528
Geez... Why did it turn ◙out like this？
00529
(...？)
00530
Kind and obedient, I guess.
00531
Hmm... You like obedient ◙girls, huh？
00532
Yeah, feminine and maybe a ◙bit shy. That would be ◙great.
00533
It would be hard for me to ◙become like that... But if ◙you like...
00534
？？？
00535
Enough... I don't care ◙anymore.
00536
(...▲MANAKA▲？)
00537
Actually... It has to be ◙someone just like ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00538
Hey... Don't try to flatter ◙me.
00539
It's not flattery. I ◙really mean it.
00540
Okay... I'll try a bit ◙harder then.
00541
(I definitely like you as ◙you are now, ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00542
○○○○○○○○
00543
By the way...
00544
Manaka
00545
Hmm？ Yes？
00546
Lately, what do you do when ◙you're at home ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00547
Lately I just do absolutely ◙nothing.
00548
I just lie on my bed ◙hugging my pillow...
00549
And think about various ◙things？
00550
I guess so...
00551
Hmm？ Do you usually fall ◙asleep just like that？
00552
...I can't sleep. That's ◙why...
00553
......
00554
Huh？
00555
Enough, you thickhead...
00556
(...？)
00557
○○○○○○○○
00558
By the way...
00559
Manaka
00560
Hmm？ Yes？
00561
What do you usually do when ◙you are at home ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00562
Lately, I started reading ◙magazines to check out ◙fashions, hairstyle, and ◙stuff like that.
00563
Eh？ You also read those, ◙▲MANAKA▲！？
00564
...You're that surprised？
00565
Yes, a little bit... I ◙can't imagine you buying ◙magazines.
00566
Well, I've never been ◙interested in them until I ◙met you, I guess.
00567
Then... You started reading ◙them because of me, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00568
...Next time, we should go ◙buy magazines together. I ◙want to know what you like.
00569
(You're just too cute ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00570
○○○○○○○○
00571
By the way...
00572
Manaka
00573
Hmm？ Yes？
00574
Lately, what do you do when ◙you're at home, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00575
Lately... I would play the ◙piano while pondering ◙various things.
00576
Pondering while playing ◙the piano！？ That sounds ◙very difficult to do.
00577
It depends, I guess. If ◙I'm playing an easy song, ◙I can chat while playing ◙as well.
00578
Hmm... Then what have you ◙been pondering about？
00579
Many things. I've been ◙thinking about you, too.
00580
What？ ...What about me？
00581
Well, I wonder. I'd better ◙hurry home and start ◙playing the piano▼
00582
(Um, now I'm curious...)
00583
○○○○○○○○
00584
By the way...
00585
Manaka
00586
Hmm？ Yes？
00587
How's everything at home ◙lately, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00588
The other day, Mama bought ◙a really amazing sponge. ◙Now I'm so in the mood for ◙cleaning.
00589
Huh？ Is it that good？
00590
Yeah, last time I spilled ◙my tea and the floor got a ◙big stain...
00591
I used this sponge and the ◙stain turned into just a ◙tiny dot. It was fun.
00592
But, I won't be able to ◙use it again.
00593
Why？
00594
I got scolded for polishing ◙things without asking. Now, ◙there's only one spot on my ◙bed that looks off-color.
00595
T-That's...
00596
...I think I overdid it.
00597
(So, you're the type that ◙can't stop yourself once ◙you get into something huh, ◙▲MANAKA▲？)
00598
Manaka
00599
Can I ask you a question, ◙▲PLAYER▲？
00600
○○○○○○○○
00601
Yes, go ahead.
00602
Hey, lately, have you been ◙oversleeping in the ◙morning？
00603
In the morning？ Well... ◙In the morning... I...
00604
I can get up easily
00605
I can barely get up
00606
A man must get up early！
00607
I stay up until morning！
00608
Well, I can get up very ◙easily.
00609
Is that so...？
00610
Eh？ Is that something ◙unexpected？
00611
No！ It sure feels good ◙waking up in the morning, ◙right？
00612
Right！ The early bird gets ◙the worm, right？
00613
Yeah... That's right...
00614
(...？)
00615
Well, I can barely get up.
00616
As I thought. If you don't ◙fully wake up, you'll be ◙spacing out all day long.
00617
I know that, but it's not ◙easy to do.
00618
No good. You'll have to do ◙something with it, okay？
00619
I can't.
00620
No. I'll also help to make ◙sure you fully wake up, all ◙right？
00621
(Is she going to give me a ◙morning call？)
00622
A man must get up early！ ◙Isn't that right？
00623
T-That's right. Yeah.
00624
Yeah. It's like we have to ◙be ready for the battle. ◙It's a basis for an able ◙man.
00625
You don't have to be an ◙able man then...
00626
It's not something to be ◙proud of, but I usually ◙stay up until morning！
00627
Hey... That's totally not ◙something to be proud of.
00628
Hehe！
00629
Then it must be hard for ◙you to get up in the ◙morning, right？
00630
Nah, not hard. I mean I'll ◙just keep sleeping. Will ◙you wake me up then？
00631
Hey, don't get too full of ◙yourself. But maybe I ◙really should help wake ◙you up, huh？
00632
(Help？ How？)
