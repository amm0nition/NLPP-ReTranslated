Um, this game syncs with ◙the clock inside your 3DS. ◙Make sure you have it set ◙correctly.
00030
If the time is wrong, ◙turn off the power once ◙and set the clock of the ◙3DS system.
00031
Once you start the game ◙you can't change it. ◙Please, be careful.
00032
Manaka
00033
Now, set the time that ◙suits your lifestyle. ◙If you aren't sure, you ◙can change between them.
00034
Manaka
00035
Is that really okay？
00036
Manaka
00037
Thank you for working so ◙hard. This completes the ◙clock settings.
