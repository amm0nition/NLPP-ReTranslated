00007
Miyoshi
00008
If you're looking for ◙Takane, she just headed ◙towards the tennis courts.
00009
！？
00010
Um, and you are...
00011
Oh, I'm Takane's friend.
00012
I see...
00013
I don't know if I should ◙say this, but Takane was ◙crying when she was at ◙Dixie's with us.
00014
▲MANAKA▲ was crying...？
00015
She went to the courts, ◙right？ Thank you！
00016
▲MANAKA▲！
00017
Manaka
00018
▲PLAYER▲...
00019
What are you doing here...？
00020
Hmm... I...
00021
This is where we met for ◙the first time. Do you ◙remember...？
00022
I remember... You were ◙practicing your serves ◙alone, right ▲MANAKA▲？
00023
Yes... I can't imagine ◙what would've happened to ◙me if I hadn't met you ◙that day...
00024
I'm sure things would have ◙remained the same, even ◙now...
00025
It was a hot day... And, ◙you were carrying a huge ◙kettle all by yourself. ◙It was hard work, right ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00026
Yes... And now, all the ◙other girls would ◙offer to help if I wanted ◙to do something like that.
00027
But, I can't imagine what ◙would've happened if I ◙hadn't met you that day...
00028
You were sweeping leaves ◙on the courts by ◙yourself, right ▲MANAKA▲？
00029
Yet now, all the other ◙girls would offer ◙to help if I wanted to do ◙something like that.
00030
It was a cold day... ◙You were cleaning the ◙clubroom by yourself. You ◙did all that to welcome me, ◙the new member...
00031
Yeah, I kept wondering ◙what kind of person would ◙join us, and...
00032
What kind of person am I？
00033
You are... the person who ◙changed me.
00034
At that time, I had a ◙strange feeling when I saw ◙you. I still remember it.
00035
A strange feeling？
00036
Yes. On that day, I felt ◙like good things were ◙going to come my way.
00037
And it was true... Even ◙now, everything still ◙seems like a dream.
00038
That's why... I couldn't ◙help but want to escape ◙from it.
00039
When everyone began to ◙gossip about our ◙relationship... I became ◙so afraid.
00040
I've changed so much since ◙the time I met you...
00041
You have been so kind to ◙me ever since we met, ◙but...
00042
......
00043
I don't know if this is ◙all one-sided... or if I'm ◙making any sense... I ◙have no confidence...
00044
That's why, even if you ◙hate me for this...
00045
There is something that I ◙really want to tell you.
00046
I've fallen in love with ◙you.
00047
▲MANAKA▲...
00048
No matter what I do, I ◙can't stop thinking of ◙you...
00049
It's like I can't control ◙myself anymore and I'm so ◙afraid...
00050
I love you so much... it ◙makes me want to cry.
00051
I... love you.
00052
So, I wish you would also ◙love me... And...
00053
I want to hear you say, ◙"Manaka is my girlfriend"...
00054
▲MANAKA▲...
00055
I love you, too
00056
I'm sorry
00057
You are my girlfriend, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00058
Really？
00059
Yes. I've wanted to say ◙this for a really long ◙time.
00060
Sorry, I should have said ◙something earlier...
00061
It's fine... It's fine... ◙So, from now on, we are...
00062
...Yeah.
00063
Right... What am I going ◙to do？ I'm too nervous.
00064
▲MANAKA▲. ◙...Come here.
00065
Can I... kiss you？
00066
Is it... something we ◙shouldn't be doing？
00067
I wonder...
00068
We'll know if we try it, ◙right？
00069
I guess...
00070
Maybe we really shouldn't ◙have done that...
00071
Why？
00072
Because... from now on, I ◙don't think I'll ever ◙feel this happy again...
00073
I love you... I really ◙love you.
00074
The truth is, I don't think ◙of you that way...
00075
I really like you, but I ◙don't think it's the sort ◙of "like" you're hoping ◙for, ▲MANAKA▲.
00076
That's why...
00077
I'm sorry...
00078
Don't apologize. I don't ◙want to trouble you. I ◙really do love you, so I ◙don't want to see you sad.
00079
What will happen to us ◙after this...？
00080
Let's stay good friends. ◙We can be best friends.
00081
Best friends...？ Yes, let's ◙do that.
00082
This way, we can still be ◙together...
00083
Yeah...
00084
So, please continue to be ◙kind to me, okay？

Hey, let's get some ◙noodles. Noodles！

！？

Takane-chan...？ W-What's ◙wrong？

I'm sorry... But I want to ◙be alone with him.

00104
Boy B
00105
Eh！？ Could it be that you ◙two...
00106
Ah, y-yes... Then let's go ◙that way！
00107
For real~！？ Say it ain't ◙so, Takane-chan~！
00108
What was that all of a ◙sudden...？
00109
Yeah... What's wrong with ◙me...？
00110
...？
00111
I really wanted to walk ◙home with you today no ◙matter what...
00112
I didn't want anyone to ◙interrupt us. And without ◙thinking, I just did ◙that...
00113
Well, that's okay. You ◙really have changed, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00114
Yeah... I think so too.
00115
Hey, do you remember？ On ◙that day, we met here for ◙the first time.
00116
I remember... You were ◙practicing your serves ◙alone, right ▲MANAKA▲？
00117
Yeah, at that time...
00118
I thought that as long as ◙I did the right thing, it ◙would be okay even if I ◙was alone.
00119
That's why I was practicing ◙by myself when everyone ◙else went out to have fun.
00120
It was such a hot day... ◙And you were carrying a ◙really huge kettle by ◙yourself, ▲MANAKA▲.
00121
But now, I know that all ◙the other girls would ◙offer to help me.
00122
Isn't that great？
00123
Back then, I didn't know ◙that being friends with ◙everyone could be this ◙much fun.
00124
You were sweeping leaves ◙on the courts by ◙yourself, ▲MANAKA▲.
00125
It was such a cold day... ◙You were cleaning the ◙clubroom by yourself ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00126
Yeah, I kept wondering ◙what kind of person would ◙join our club...
00127
So finishing the cleaning ◙by myself wasn't actually ◙that hard.
00128
Geez, feels like that was ◙ages ago.
00129
Um, well...
00130
Back then, I never ◙imagined I could become ◙the way I am now...
00131
While I was waiting for ◙you this evening, I was ◙thinking...
00132
I was thinking about why I ◙wanted to see you so ◙much...
00133
I'm sure that I really ◙have changed.
00134
You were the one who taught ◙me to be honest with my ◙feelings.
00135
I have finally realized...
00136
The way I am now... You're ◙the one who made it ◙possible.
00137
I kept wondering how many ◙times our eyes met today, ◙or when we would be able ◙to meet again...
00138
I wanted to hear your ◙voice. I wanted to be ◙closer to you.
00139
It's embarrassing how much ◙you were on my mind...
00140
That's why... I want you ◙to let me be by your ◙side.
00141
I can't stop thinking of ◙you. I love you so much. ◙So, please...
00142
▲MANAKA▲...
00143
I love you, too
00144
I'm sorry
00145
I have always been thinking ◙of you, all this time, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00146
Eh？
00147
For a long time now, I've ◙only been thinking of ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00148
Really？
00149
Yeah... We feel the same ◙way, ▲MANAKA▲.
00150
I'm so happy...
00151
Then... Do you know what I ◙am thinking right now？
00152
...I probably do.
00153
...Can I kiss you？
00154
Don't ask...
00155
Sorry...
00156
Hehe... Do it.
00157
......
00158
It's a little, you know, ◙embarrassing...
00159
Yeah...
00160
Um...
00161
Hmm？
00162
I love you...
00163
Actually, I don't think of ◙you that way...
00164
Your feelings are probably ◙different from mine, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00165
For me, I only see ◙you as a very dear friend, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00166
I'm sorry.
00167
No.
00168
Thank you... At least you ◙told me your true feelings.
00169
Actually, I kind of knew ◙that it might turn out ◙like this.
00170
But I wanted to be honest ◙with myself. That's why...
00171
From now on, we'll both be ◙fine, right？
00172
I see... That's why you've ◙been trying so hard, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00173
That's right. I worked ◙hard, didn't I？
00174
Yeah, you did great.
00175
Yeah... Then let's be best ◙friends from now on.
00176
Yeah, sure.

Hey, can we go to the ◙tennis courts right now...？
00196
Sure, okay...
00197
Shall we go？
00198
Somehow, I get the feeling ◙that they were making fun ◙of us...
00199
Yeah...
00200
What's up with them？
00201
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
00202
I only told one close friend, ◙but now the whole club ◙seems to know...
00203
...？
00204
I told her... that I was ◙going to confess to you ◙today...
00205
Hey, do you remember that ◙this is the place where we ◙first met？
00206
I remember. On that day, ◙no one else was here. Only ◙you, ▲MANAKA▲...
00207
Yeah... I was practicing ◙my serves at the time.
00208
That's right...
00209
Even when everyone else ◙went on a break, I just ◙couldn't stop practicing.
00210
I thought that it was the ◙right thing to do...
00211
It was a really hot day... ◙And you were carrying a ◙huge kettle, right？ You ◙were really working hard, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00212
I did that for everyone ◙and I thought that it was ◙what I had to do...
00213
You were sweeping leaves ◙on the courts by ◙yourself, right ▲MANAKA▲？
00214
It was a cold day... ◙You were cleaning the ◙clubroom, right ▲MANAKA▲？
00215
Yeah... Although no one ◙asked me to do that...
00216
I thought that I had to ◙make it clean...
00217
Actually, at that time, I ◙felt so lonely that I ◙almost cried...
00218
When you called out to me, ◙I was really happy.
00219
Is that so...？
00220
I've wanted to tell you ◙this ever since we met.
00221
It's very simple but it ◙requires courage... And I ◙don't want to hold it in ◙anymore.
00222
I will be honest with ◙myself.
00223
When I want to see you, ◙I'll say it.
00224
When I'm lonely, I'll tell ◙you that I want to be by ◙your side.
00225
I've really fallen in love ◙with you.
00226
I... love you...
00227
......
00228
I love you, too
00229
Sorry
00230
▲MANAKA▲... ◙I want you to always be by ◙my side.
00231
...I'm so happy.
00232
I'm also happy. Because I ◙love you too, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00233
▲MANAKA▲？
00234
I thought my feelings for ◙you would remain unrequited ◙forever...
00235
I'm so happy... But I still ◙can't believe that this is ◙really happening.
00236
This is the real thing, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00237
Then make me believe...
00238
...Can I kiss you？
00239
The others are watching ◙us... Is that okay...？
00240
Then... Just look at me. ◙Only me...
00241
That's true...
00242
Hey, is it okay for me to ◙be honest with you？
00243
What is it？
00244
Once isn't enough...
00245
I love you...
00246
I don't think of you that ◙way...
00247
Your feelings are probably ◙different from mine, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00248
That's why if I said yes, ◙I would just be lying to ◙you...
00249
I'm sorry.
00250
No.
00251
I kind of knew that it ◙might turn out like this.
00252
So, just being able to ◙tell you my true feelings ◙was enough.
00253
I'll just have to live ◙with this unrequited love...
00254
May I ask you for one last ◙thing？
00255
Is it all right if I ◙continue to love you？
00256
But, I...
00257
It's fine like this. ◙Because at least you don't ◙hate me.
00258
Okay, I understand.
00259
Thank you. See you later, ◙okay？
