00000
Manaka
00001
Hey, can I ask you a ◙question？
00002
○○○○○○○○
00003
What？
00004
Am I... good enough？
00005
Eh！？
00006
Sometimes I feel uneasy. I ◙wonder why you chose me. I ◙wonder what part of me you ◙like, and stuff.
00007
...Perhaps there might be ◙a girl that suits you much ◙better...
00008
Stop！
00009
......
00010
Stop imagining things ◙without considering my ◙feelings！
00011
Ah... That's right... I'm ◙sorry.
00012
(Hmm... How can I make you ◙understand this ◙▲MANAKA▲？)
00013
○○○○○○○○
00014
About what we talked about ◙earlier, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00015
Manaka
00016
...Yeah.
00017
Why do you love me？ There ◙might be a guy that suits ◙you better than me, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00018
T-There is no one who can ◙take your place...！
00019
I see. Then you can rest ◙assured, because I feel the ◙same way too.
00020
...Eh？
00021
It's not just some parts ◙of you that I like. If I ◙had to say, it would be ◙everything about you.
00022
And you feel the same way, ◙right？
00023
...Not at all. It's not ◙the same...
00024
I definitely love you ◙more... I'm not losing to ◙you.
00025
All right. From now on, ◙we'll see who wins, okay？
00026
Manaka
00027
Have you ever thought about ◙the mechanisms of falling ◙in love？
00028
○○○○○○○○
00029
Hmm, before I realized it, ◙I already loved you. That's ◙why I said yes when you ◙confessed to me, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00030
I'm so happy. Anyway, even ◙though you said so, there ◙are things that I'm quite ◙concerned about.
00031
▲MANAKA▲...
00032
Ah, no. I didn't mean that ◙I feel unsatisfied or ◙uneasy...
00033
I'm just wondering where ◙these feelings of love ◙come from...
00034
For me, I've never really ◙hated anyone in my life. ◙But I've never loved ◙anyone this much either.
00035
That's why I think that ◙love is amazing, and I ◙wonder what are behind ◙these feelings of love.
00036
(It really is amazing...)
00037
Manaka
00038
We've talked about the ◙mechanisms of falling in ◙love earlier, right？
00039
○○○○○○○○
00040
Yeah. Did you find the ◙answer？
00041
Hmm... No matter how hard ◙I think about it, I can ◙never understand it.
00042
But, I recalled some people ◙saying that love doesn't ◙need reason.
00043
When I think about it, it's ◙really true. So, it's ◙probably better that I just ◙stop thinking about this.
00044
Is that so？
00045
Yeah, I know there are many ◙theories about love, but I ◙don't care anymore.
00046
Just being able to see you ◙is the only answer I need.
00047
...Yeah.
00048
Hehe. Thanks for listening ◙to me. Ah, I spent too much ◙time thinking about this ◙that I've slacked off on ◙studying lately！
00049
(▲MANAKA▲...)
00050
Manaka
00051
It's almost your birthday, ◙huh？
00052
○○○○○○○○
00053
Ah, it's coming up soon.
00054
Yes, it is. Geez... Are ◙guys always like this？
00055
What do you mean？
00056
Do guys usually not pay ◙attention to their own ◙birthday？
00057
I don't know. What about ◙you ▲MANAKA▲？
00058
Yeah. I always get excited ◙about my birthday.
00059
It's another year for me to ◙grow older and experience ◙new things.
00060
I can't help but think ◙about what will be coming ◙next and whether I'll meet ◙new people.
00061
I see. You really think a ◙lot about your birthday...
00062
Hey, how come the topic was ◙changed to my birthday？ We ◙were talking about your ◙birthday to begin with！
00063
Manaka
00064
Hey, about your birthday...
00065
○○○○○○○○
00066
...Ah.
00067
...Geez. You forgot about ◙it.
00068
Hahaha. I'm more concerned ◙about your birthday ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00069
Really？
00070
Of course. I've been ◙thinking about it a lot. ◙Even now.
00071
...Hmm.
00072
That's your response？ Just ◙that？
00073
What do you mean by "just ◙that"？
00074
Ah, you're getting ◙embarrassed.
00075
...I am not. It's not about ◙my birthday. I was talking ◙about yours. Geez！
00076
(I wonder what she's ◙planning for my birthday.)
00077
Manaka
00078
Huh...
00079
○○○○○○○○
00080
What？ Is it about my ◙birthday？
00081
Hmm？ You remember it？
00082
Y-Yeah, I remember.
00083
...Hehe, geez. I wish you ◙just forgot about it.
00084
Shall I？
00085
You just try to play along, ◙huh？ Geez, someone like ◙you... Hehehe！
00086
By the way, you seem to ◙think about it a lot. Did ◙you get anything for me yet？
00087
I wish I did.
00088
You didn't！？
00089
Huh？ I thought you didn't ◙care about it. Hehehe.
00090
(Urgh, why is she the one ◙teasing me now？)
00091
○○○○○○○○
00092
Hey, for my birthday...
00093
Manaka
00094
Hmm？ Now, you've started ◙to care about it, huh？
00095
I've never said that I ◙didn't care about it.
00096
Okay, okay. Hmm, I can tell ◙you that I already got ◙something for you. Just ◙don't expect too much.
00097
No, I'm really expecting ◙something nice.
00098
Hehe, why？
00099
Because you've been ◙thinking about it for a ◙long time. Even longer than ◙I have.
00100
....Because it's the day ◙you were born. Isn't it ◙something I should feel ◙thankful for？
00101
▲MANAKA▲...
00102
Oh well. I'll have to wait ◙until your birthday to ◙wish you a happy birthday, ◙right！？
00103
○○○○○○○○
00104
It's almost your birthday, ◙huh, ▲MANAKA▲？
00105
Manaka
00106
Ah, you remembered.
00107
Yeah. Does your family have ◙any plans for your ◙birthday, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00108
Yeah. We always celebrate ◙a family member's birthday ◙together.
00109
Like, do you bake a cake ◙together？
00110
Right. It's a Takane ◙tradition to bake a cake ◙for a family member whose ◙birthday is coming up.
00111
...You mean your dad also ◙bakes a cake？
00112
Of course. He's always in ◙high spirits, and he takes ◙a day off from work every ◙year for the occasion.
00113
He does！？
00114
Hehe, Papa is very obsessed ◙with stuff like this.
00115
I wonder what kind of cake ◙he'll make this year... I ◙can't wait▼
00116
(If I don't try my best, ◙maybe she won't appreciate ◙it when we celebrate her ◙birthday together！)
00117
Manaka
00118
By the way, Papa told me ◙that the cake he planned ◙to bake for me this year ◙would be something I've ◙never tasted before.
00119
○○○○○○○○
00120
E-Eh？ ...What kind of cake ◙is that？
00121
He wouldn't tell me.
00122
I only know that he asked ◙his friend in France to ◙send him a secret recipe.
00123
France！？
00124
Yeah. I'm very happy but I ◙think he overdid it. ◙Anyway, he told me that he ◙didn't want to lose.
00125
...Lose to who？
00126
For that, he didn't tell ◙me and Mama only smiled as ◙if it were something that ◙couldn't be helped.
00127
But I'm so curious what ◙kind of cake it'll be... I ◙really can't wait▼
00128
(The one her dad doesn't ◙want to lose to... Could ◙it be...)
00129
○○○○○○○○
00130
How was your dad after ◙that？
00131
Manaka
00132
Seems like he practiced ◙baking it once, but it ◙didn't come out well. Mama ◙said that he was quite ◙disappointed.
00133
I see...
00134
And then he asked about ◙you.
00135
Eh...？ About me？
00136
Yeah, like whether you knew ◙my birthday, and whether ◙you had said something ◙about it...
00137
When I asked him why he ◙was concerned about that, ◙he said he was just ◙collecting information.
00138
...What！！
00139
I don't understand... Do ◙you know why he said that？
00140
(As I thought, his rival is ◙me！)
00141
○○○○○○○○
00142
Your birthday is coming up.
00143
Manaka
00144
Yeah, I hope it'll be a ◙special one this year.
00145
A special one？
00146
Yeah, we've been talking ◙about my birthday all this ◙time until now, right？
00147
And you've been very ◙concerned about it for so ◙long. Actually, that's ◙already more than enough ◙for me.
00148
Now I'm in trouble.
00149
Eh？
00150
At least, I want you to ◙anticipate something from ◙me. That way I can keep ◙trying my best for you.
00151
Hmm？ So I can anticipate ◙something nice？
00152
Y-Yeah.
00153
Hehe！ Okay, I'll do as you ◙wish. You have to try very ◙hard, all right？
00154
(I won't lose to your ◙dad！)
00155
Manaka
00156
It's been almost a year, ◙huh？
00157
○○○○○○○○
00158
Really？ It's been a year ◙already？
00159
...Hmm？ You realized it at ◙once, huh？
00160
Well, I should, right？
00161
Hehe, sorry. I didn't mean ◙to tease you.
00162
It feels like just a blink ◙of an eye, right？ Since the ◙time we started dating...
00163
When I recall the moment I ◙confessed to you, I still ◙feel so embarrassed.
00164
I was really happy when you ◙confessed to me, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00165
Hey, don't say it... ◙Please, I  beg you. Don't ◙look at me now.
00166
(You've never changed, ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00167
Manaka
00168
Hey, usually, what do ◙people do when it's time ◙for an important occasion？
00169
○○○○○○○○
00170
Ah, you mean for our ◙anniversary？
00171
Yeah, this is my first time ◙to be in a relationship, ◙so I don't really know...
00172
Hmm... What shall we do？
00173
When you speak that way, I ◙kind of wonder if you've ◙already had plans in your ◙mind.
00174
Hahaha. Exactly.
00175
Well, we don't really have ◙to think about it too ◙seriously, right？ Let's ◙not pressure ourselves.
00176
Hehe, we can treat everyday ◙like our anniversary, huh？
00177
Right. But the first ◙anniversary should be ◙special.
00178
Yeah, I hope it would be ◙something that we still ◙think about no matter how ◙many years have passed...
00179
Manaka
00180
Hey, how about we use this ◙chance to tell each other ◙if there's anything we want ◙each other to improve？
00181
○○○○○○○○
00182
To improve...？
00183
...Nothing？
00184
Hmm... How about you, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00185
Hmm, I don't have anything ◙in particular, I think.
00186
I don't have any either.
00187
...Hehe. So, it seems our ◙conversation ends here.
00188
Haha, we'll just keep being ◙nice to each other, okay？
00189
Okay▼
00190
Manaka
00191
Hehe, our anniversary is ◙coming up.
00192
○○○○○○○○
00193
Yeah. Thanks for being nice ◙to me this whole year.
00194
Don't mention it. I have to ◙thank you, too.
00195
...Hehe.
00196
Hahaha...
00197
...I wish we could continue ◙having a conversation like ◙this forever.
00198
Our next milestone is the ◙next 3 years, okay？
00199
No, 5 years！
00200
Nah, 10 years！
00201
Hehe, I want more！
00202
Haha, right！ Let's try our ◙best.
00203
Okay▼
00204
Manaka
00205
...Can I ask you a question？
00206
○○○○○○○○
00207
Yes, what？
00208
Well... Is it really okay ◙for you to have me by your ◙side？
00209
Eh！？
00210
I'm sorry！
00211
I think we're happy like ◙this, but...
00212
I don't if I'm the only one ◙feeling happy. I'm so ◙worried...
00213
This is my first time to be ◙in a relationship, so I ◙don't really know anything.
00214
▲MANAKA▲...
00215
...Sorry. I shouldn't say ◙something like this ◙anymore.
00216
(How can I let you know ◙how I feel...？)
00217
○○○○○○○○
00218
About the question you ◙asked me earlier, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00219
Manaka
00220
......
00221
Is it really okay for you ◙to have me by your side ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00222
How can it not be okay！？
00223
I'm okay to have you by my ◙side... No, I mean if it's ◙not you, I can't...
00224
I see. We both can rest ◙assured then！
00225
I see. We both can rest ◙assured then！
00226
Am I really good for you？
00227
It has to be you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00228
...I...
00229
Hey, come here.
00230
...Okay！
00231
Manaka
00232
How can people love someone ◙so much？
00233
○○○○○○○○
00234
Huh？
00235
I've been thinking about ◙this lately. There's ◙probably something special.
00236
In the past, I didn't have ◙any particular feelings ◙for anyone. I just loved ◙everyone and cared about ◙everyone...
00237
I used to be like that, but ◙now...
00238
......
00239
I really don't know. ◙Something must have changed ◙inside me.
00240
I wonder why I have this ◙kind of feeling... This is ◙mysterious.
00241
(Um, I also wonder why...)
00242
Manaka
00243
Earlier, we talked about ◙how people can love someone ◙so much, right？
00244
○○○○○○○○
00245
Yeah, did you find out the ◙reason？
00246
Yeah. For me, the answer ◙is... because it's you.
00247
Me？
00248
...Right. If it wasn't ◙you... I wouldn't have been ◙able to love someone this ◙much, for sure.
00249
You are my first love, and ◙the first person who made ◙me feel this way...
00250
I'm so glad that my first ◙love is you. Thank you for ◙always being by my side.
00251
...No. This is like I'm ◙confessing my love to you ◙all over again.
00252
But, this is really how I ◙feel. Please let me love ◙you like this forever, okay？
00253
(▲MANAKA▲...)
00254
Manaka
00255
Hey, it's almost your ◙birthday, right？
00256
○○○○○○○○
00257
Ah, now that you mentioned ◙it...
00258
Is there anything you want？
00259
What I want？ Hmm...
00260
I'll ask you again later, ◙so think about it, okay？ ◙...Ah.
00261
Huh？
00262
For something like this, is ◙it better that I keep it a ◙secret？ You might want a ◙surprise.
00263
Hmm, a surprise is nice, ◙too.
00264
Really？ But I want you to ◙be happy to get what you ◙want...
00265
Hmm, what should I do？ ◙Hmm... Hmm...
00266
(...She's just so cute like ◙this. I'll keep watching ◙her for a while.)
00267
○○○○○○○○
00268
Have you decided whether ◙you want to hear my request ◙or not？
00269
Manaka
00270
Not yet... Can you give me ◙some more time to think？
00271
That's fine. For the ◙meantime, I'll think about ◙it more seriously too.
00272
Hey, is it okay that you ◙just give me some hints？
00273
Hmm... But if I know ◙beforehand what kind of ◙thing I'll get, it won't be ◙a surprise when I see it.
00274
...Hmm, that's true.
00275
But just some vague hints ◙would be okay, right？
00276
...Hmm...
00277
How about a chopstick rest？ ◙Will you like it？ Or a ◙doll？ That's not good, ◙right？ Hey, which one do ◙you like？
00278
(I wouldn't call them vague ◙hints...)
00279
○○○○○○○○
00280
Well, my birthday's getting ◙very close, huh...？
00281
Manaka
00282
Hmm...
00283
Hahaha, it's okay. There's ◙no need to rush.
00284
I don't think you have to ◙pay attention to it this ◙much.
00285
No, I have to.
00286
It represents the day you ◙were born into this world. ◙It's a very important day.
00287
Is it troublesome for you ◙that I'm getting this happy ◙about it？
00288
No, not at all. I'm very ◙thankful.
00289
Okay. I was quite worried ◙that I might cause you ◙trouble. Now I'm a bit ◙relieved.
00290
I'll think about it ◙carefully, so please just ◙wait, okay？
00291
Okay, roger that！
00292
Manaka
00293
I've decided.
00294
○○○○○○○○
00295
Oh, so this is an official ◙announcement, huh？
00296
Hehe, I've decided to keep ◙it a secret.
00297
I see. Okay, I'll be ◙looking forward to it then.
00298
But, please don't expect ◙too much, okay？
00299
Eh？
00300
Um... Um... I've really ◙tried my best, but...
00301
Hahaha, I was just kidding. ◙When I have you with me, I ◙don't need anything else, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00302
is this right？ ...T-Thank ◙you...
00303
Ah, I shouldn't be easily ◙overjoyed like this, right？ ◙Is it okay that I'm happy ◙about it？
00304
(For me, something like ◙this is more than enough！)
00305
○○○○○○○○
00306
It's almost your birthday, ◙right, ▲MANAKA▲？
00307
Manaka
00308
Yeah. Thank you for ◙remembering it.
00309
Has your family started ◙talking about this？
00310
Not yet. Hehe, you're ◙pretty fast.
00311
Hahaha, I see.
00312
We bake some cake at home ◙every year, but we don't ◙really talk about it like ◙this.
00313
Don't tell me you bake your ◙own birthday cakes, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00314
No, Papa is always the one ◙baking it for me.
00315
Huh？ So it's like that in ◙your family, huh？
00316
Yeah, it's quite thrilling ◙every year. Hehe.
00317
(Huh？ That means he's not ◙very good at it, eh？)
00318
○○○○○○○○
00319
Do you have a big birthday ◙party at home ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00320
Manaka
00321
Not a big one, but there's ◙always a party.
00322
We eat cake, sing "Happy ◙Birthday," and then I open ◙the presents, something ◙like that.
00323
Our dinner will be a little ◙bit more special. We ◙reminisce about the old ◙days while we're eating.
00324
Reminisce about the old ◙days？
00325
Yeah, something about when ◙I was in grade school or ◙when Papa and Mama were ◙young.
00326
Hmm... That sounds fun.
00327
Hehe, I usually stay up ◙late on my birthday.
00328
I'm hoping I can stay up ◙even later this year.
00329
Like, until 9:30 PM？
00330
...I can stay longer than ◙that... I think.
00331
(But that's about your ◙limit, isn't it...？)
00332
○○○○○○○○
00333
Hey, do you have anything ◙you want to ask from me ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00334
Manaka
00335
Hmm？ What do you mean？
00336
Do you have any requests？ ◙Like something you want ◙or somewhere you want to ◙visit？
00337
Hmm... I don't have any.
00338
Huh？ None at all？
00339
Yes, just hearing you say ◙"Happy Birthday" to me is ◙enough.
00340
Of course, I'll be saying ◙that.
00341
Hehe. Just that is more ◙than enough. You don't have ◙to concern yourself about ◙it too much. Thank you.
00342
(Hmm... What should I get ◙for her then...？)
00343
Manaka
00344
About what you asked me ◙earlier, whether I had a ◙request for my birthday ◙present or not...
00345
○○○○○○○○
00346
Oh！ You've got something ◙you want？
00347
Yes... I want you.
00348
Okay, that's good... What！？
00349
One year from now, I want ◙you to always be with me. ◙And on my next birthday, ◙I'll request the same ◙thing. Is this not okay？
00350
...I was just surprised. ◙Of course, it's okay... ◙But you want just this？
00351
What do you mean by "just" ◙this？
00352
Because I'll always be with ◙you no matter what, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00353
......
00354
That's all I want to hear. ◙Thank you. You've made me ◙feel very happy even before ◙my birthday has arrived.
00355
You can look forward to my ◙request every year, okay？
00356
(▲MANAKA▲...)
00357
○○○○○○○○
00358
It's been a year, huh...？
00359
Manaka
00360
Hmm？ What？
00361
Come on, it's almost a year ◙since we started dating.
00362
...Yeah. It went by very ◙fast.
00363
In the beginning, I kept ◙thinking what it would feel ◙like after a year has ◙passed...
00364
Nothing has changed, right？
00365
......
00366
Hmm？
00367
No... To have you by my ◙side, and to talk about ◙this with you...
00368
A lot of wonderful things ◙have happened. Yeah.
00369
(What was with that quiet ◙moment？ I'm a bit ◙concerned...)
00370
○○○○○○○○
00371
Hey, earlier, we talked ◙about what would happen ◙after we've been together ◙for a year, right？
00372
Manaka
00373
...Yeah.
00374
At that time, was there ◙something in your mind？
00375
...Hehehe. I really can't ◙hide anything from you...
00376
To tell you the truth... ◙I was about to tell you ◙that I couldn't believe ◙that you would still be ◙with me after a year.
00377
Eh！？
00378
I don't have the ◙confidence... I don't know ◙if it's okay to be happy ◙about what we are now...
00379
...That was what I thought ◙about back then...
00380
Ah, but I'm okay now. After ◙you said so many things to ◙me, I've gained a little ◙more confidence.
00381
So, don't worry... Sorry ◙for saying something weird.
00382
(Just "a little" more ◙confidence...？)
00383
○○○○○○○○
00384
Is there anything about me ◙you want me to improve, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00385
Manaka
00386
Hehe, why ask this all of ◙a sudden？
00387
Come on. We've been ◙together for so long. Just ◙tell me the truth.
00388
Hmm... Maybe nothing？
00389
Really？
00390
...Yup.
00391
No, there's something！
00392
Eh？ Hey, this has happened ◙before... How did you know ◙what I was thinking？
00393
That's because I'm your ◙boyfriend.
00394
...Hmm, is that so？
00395
Now I have a lot more ◙confidence...
00396
(Yeah, this is going ◙great！)
00397
○○○○○○○○
00398
A year's passed, hasn't it？
00399
Manaka
00400
Yeah. Thank you for the ◙past year. Um, I...
00401
Huh？
00402
Is it OK if I stay by your ◙side like this for the next ◙year, too？
00403
...Ah？
00404
Well, I want to continue ◙being with you like this. ◙So... please treat me ◙kindly, okay？
00405
Oh, same here. Please treat ◙me well.
00406
Okay▼
00407
Manaka
00408
Hey, I have a question.
00409
○○○○○○○○
00410
Hmm？？ What is it？
00411
...Do you regret that I ◙became your girlfriend？
00412
Why are you saying this all ◙of a sudden...？ Did I do ◙something bad？
00413
No, it's not like that. ◙It's just...
00414
It's just, I don't think I ◙have confidence in myself...
00415
▲MANAKA▲...
00416
It's like I want to ◙compensate for my own ◙worthlessness. I feel like ◙I still don't put enough ◙effort.
00417
I'm sorry. Just now, can ◙you pretend you didn't ◙hear that？
00418
(You can have all the ◙confidence in yourself ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00419
○○○○○○○○
00420
Well, I've never had any ◙regrets to have you as my ◙girlfriend, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00421
Manaka
00422
W-What is this all of a ◙sudden...？
00423
Rather,I've been wondering ◙if I'm good enough for ◙you...
00424
Hey, besides you... I've ◙never even thought about ◙anyone else.
00425
Yeah, It's the same for me, ◙too. So, we should both ◙have confidence in ◙ourselves. We're equal now.
00426
Can I really be confident？
00427
Of course！ But... Is it ◙okay that your spirit might ◙rub off on me？
00428
Hehe... It's okay if you're ◙brimming with confidence.
00429
Well then, I should do the ◙same. Otherwise, it'll be ◙unfair ▲MANAKA▲.
00430
Hehehe！ I understand... ◙From now on, let's do our ◙best together, okay？
00431
Manaka
00432
Do you know the mechanisms ◙of falling in love？
00433
○○○○○○○○
00434
Mechanisms？
00435
Yes. Everything we feel, ◙including heart throbbing ◙or the feelings of ◙happiness, is because of ◙substances in our brain.
00436
Mmm, that's rather blunt...
00437
Isn't it？ It's so ◙scientific that I'm a ◙little disappointed.
00438
It's too much if you think ◙that the way we are is ◙thanks to adrenaline, ◙endorphins and the like.
00439
Hmmm... But, is that really ◙how it is？
00440
What do you mean？
00441
I mean, do people just fall ◙in love because of that？
00442
...I wonder. But somehow, I ◙hope there's something more ◙to it than that...
00443
(▲MANAKA▲...)
00444
Manaka
00445
I've decided to stop ◙thinking about it, you know？
00446
○○○○○○○○
00447
...Ah, about the mechanisms ◙of falling in love？
00448
Yeah. Assuming that brain ◙substances are capricious ◙like that... I have that ◙kind of feeling only when ◙I'm with you.
00449
...Because I met you, I ◙fell in love with you. With ◙just that, I'm fine.
00450
▲MANAKA▲...
00451
Besides, isn't it annoying？ ◙I don't need scientific ◙talk. I can tell that I ◙love you just like this.
00452
Yeah, you could say that.
00453
Hehe, right？
00454
I think, definitely, from ◙now on... I'll grow to love ◙you more and more... You ◙accept that, right？
00455
Yeah, trust me！
00456
Manaka
00457
Say, you're a bit forgetful ◙but... Your birthday is ◙coming up soon, isn't it？
00458
○○○○○○○○
00459
Ah！.. My birthday？
00460
Hehe, yes. Not anyone ◙else's, it's yours.
00461
Really？ Looks like my ◙adulthood is approaching.
00462
To mark the occasion, do ◙you have any requests, ◙like something you want？
00463
Are you going to give me a ◙present？ Let me see it ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00464
It's okay if it's not right ◙now. So, will you think ◙about it for me？
00465
Sure, I will. But, why do ◙you look so happy？
00466
Well, it's the day my ◙darling was born and I can ◙celebrate it. Why shouldn't ◙I be happy？
00467
...Uh, um...
00468
Ah, are you embarrassed？ ◙How cute▼
00469
(When it's said right to my ◙face like that, I guess it ◙can't be helped...)
00470
Manaka
00471
Say, have you thought about ◙your request？
00472
○○○○○○○○
00473
Not yet. I really can't ◙decide yet.
00474
Being a young man, you ◙shouldn't keep thinking ◙about it for too long.
00475
Hahaha. On the other hand, ◙do you have anything you ◙want to give me ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00476
Hmm？
00477
Oh, seems like you do.
00478
It's not like I don't have ◙any, but I prefer to give ◙you something you want.
00479
I see...
00480
Because I'm interested in ◙what you'll request. Hehe, ◙I'm looking forward to it, ◙OK▼
00481
(It seems like a difficult ◙hurdle has arisen... Is it ◙just my imagination？)
00482
○○○○○○○○
00483
(I haven't given any ◙thought about my birthday ◙present request yet...)
00484
Manaka
00485
Hey！
00486
Eh！？
00487
Hehe, I can see through ◙you. With that look, you ◙haven't decided what you ◙want yet, right？
00488
Yeah...
00489
Geez, I didn't mean to make ◙you feel troubled like ◙this. Hey, how about you ◙let me pick a present for ◙you？
00490
That way... you don't have ◙to worry about it so much.
00491
Ah... right.
00492
No, it's not good that you ◙have to worry about your ◙own birthday present.
00493
(But, now I have to make ◙sure you don't worry about ◙it too much...)
00494
○○○○○○○○
00495
How is it？ Have you ◙decided what you'd do for ◙my birthday ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00496
Manaka
00497
...Hey, now you're totally ◙different.
00498
Hahaha. Of course.
00499
Hehe. Okay, okay. There's ◙some progress. You can look ◙forward to it.
00500
Oh, very confident, huh？
00501
...Yeah. Because I'm the ◙happiest person when it ◙comes to your birthday.
00502
Even more than I am？
00503
Yeah, that's why I'm ◙confident that I can make ◙you happy... Yeah.
00504
Ah, I must be the first one ◙to say Happy Birthday to ◙you. If someone else is ◙about to say it before me, ◙you've got to run away！
00505
...I'll try.
00506
No, you must run away.
00507
Haha, roger that！
00508
Very well. Yeah！ Teehee！
00509
○○○○○○○○
00510
The day of your birthday is ◙getting close, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00511
Manaka
00512
Hmm？ You remembered？
00513
Of course.
00514
Hehe. Thanks. Are you ◙planning something for me？
00515
Um, yeah. Speaking of ◙which, will you have ◙anything special at home？
00516
Yeah, it's marked on the ◙schedule of everyone in my ◙family.
00517
I see. Your family always ◙celebrates birthdays and ◙such, hmm, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00518
It'll be a big issue if ◙anyone forgets.
00519
So, you mustn't... Ah, but ◙since you mentioned it as ◙early as now, I can rest ◙assured, can't I？
00520
Yeah... I don't think I'll ◙forget...
00521
Teeheehee！
00522
○○○○○○○○
00523
Hey, up until now, what has ◙been the present that you ◙got that you liked most, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00524
Manaka
00525
What I liked most is the ◙fountain pen that Papa and ◙Mama gave me when I entered ◙junior high.
00526
Hmm... A fountain pen？
00527
Mama always uses fountain ◙pens. She looks very cool ◙when she writes. I used to ◙imitate her when I was a ◙child.
00528
It felt great when I wrote ◙with a fountain pen, so I ◙used it every day until she ◙found out.
00529
...It wasn't a nice idea to ◙write until the pen nib ◙broke.
00530
Hahaha. That's what I can ◙expect from you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00531
Then my parents gave one to ◙me as a present on the ◙entrance ceremony. But I ◙didn't want to ruin it, so ◙I didn't use it.
00532
That's kind of wasteful...
00533
Yeah, probably. Anyway, is ◙this useful as a reference？
00534
...Who knows？
00535
Hehe！ Do your best, okay？
00536
○○○○○○○○
00537
Have you ever hated your ◙birthday ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00538
Manaka
00539
Why？
00540
Sometimes when I mentioned ◙about birthdays to girls, ◙some of them looked ◙depressed.
00541
Hehe. Yeah, I think that ◙happens. But for me, I'm ◙really looking forward to ◙my birthday...
00542
Ah, I can say that it's ◙time to contemplate on ◙different things.
00543
Contemplate？
00544
Yeah, when your birthday ◙arrives, you grow up for ◙another year. It's like ◙you're getting close to ◙becoming an adult, right？
00545
That's true.
00546
This has turned to be such ◙a serious conversation, but ◙I think that's how I feel.
00547
(You really think about ◙things seriously, ◙▲MANAKA▲...)
00548
○○○○○○○○
00549
Your birthday is getting ◙closer and closer, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00550
Manaka
00551
Yeah. Hey, last time, I ◙told you that I usually ◙contemplate on different ◙things on my birthday, ◙right？
00552
Yeah, sure.
00553
But this year... I don't ◙really think much about it.
00554
Eh...？ Why？
00555
Because you're with me. ◙Just this already makes my ◙heart throb.
00556
I'm sure my birthday this ◙year will turn out to be a ◙great one. One that I'll ◙never forget.
00557
▲MANAKA▲...
00558
...Hehe！ That's why you ◙should be the first one to ◙say Happy Birthday to me ◙this year. I'll be waiting.
00559
Okay！
00560
Manaka
00561
From that time... Since I ◙confessed my love to you, ◙it's almost been a year.
00562
○○○○○○○○
00563
Really？... Yeah, it was ◙around this time.
00564
It's "already" been a year ◙or "just" a year... I'm not ◙sure how I feel. It's funny ◙how time plays tricks like ◙that.
00565
Yeah.
00566
Hehe. Many things have ◙happened during this one ◙year, huh？
00567
Yeah, so many that I can't ◙possibly count them.
00568
Hey, if the first year has ◙been like this, then how do ◙you think the later years ◙will turn out？
00569
I'm sure much more crazy ◙stuff will happen. Are you ◙ready for it？
00570
Hehe, of course. Let's ◙continue making memories ◙together.
00571
Manaka
00572
Hey, have I... become a ◙proper girlfriend for you？
00573
○○○○○○○○
00574
You're perfect as a ◙girlfriend.
00575
...You answered pretty ◙quickly. Are you sure？
00576
I'm positive. We've done ◙all sorts of things... ◙There are things I couldn't ◙have done if you weren't my ◙girlfriend.
00577
Eh！？ What are you talking ◙about？ Y-You shouldn't be ◙talking about that kind of ◙stuff here...
00578
Stuff like going out on ◙dates and holding hands ◙while we walk...
00579
Ah...！
00580
▲MANAKA▲？
00581
Hmph... forget it！
00582
(...Why is she so angry？)
00583
○○○○○○○○
00584
Let's continue what we were ◙talking about before...
00585
Manaka
00586
Oh. So, you want to say ◙more weird stuff？
00587
I wasn't going to！ I'm ◙your boyfriend, so I wonder ◙if I'm good enough, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00588
......
00589
...Why are you so quiet ◙now？
00590
Hehe, just teasing you. To ◙be honest, I think you're ◙almost too good to be my ◙boyfriend.
00591
▲MANAKA▲...
00592
It'd be great if you didn't ◙say weird things... But ◙that's what makes you who ◙you are, I suppose？
00593
Please don't ever change▼
00594
(I should be feeling happy ◙to hear this... right？)
00595
Manaka
00596
The countdown to our one ◙year anniversary has ◙started▼
00597
○○○○○○○○
00598
So it has.
00599
Hehe. I know there's a ◙saying "Don't count your ◙chickens before they hatch" ◙but...
00600
Next year, and the years ◙after that, wouldn't it be ◙nice to stay like this？
00601
Yeah, and we'll keep ◙growing together.
00602
Yeah, bit by bit, we're ◙getting there.... Until we ◙finally grow old together.
00603
Forever and ever.
00604
Forever and ever.
00605
Hahaha...
00606
Hehehe...
