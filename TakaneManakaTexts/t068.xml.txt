Manaka
00001
Do you remember the song ◙"Hato Poppo"？
00002
○○○○○○○○
00003
Yeah, I remember it from ◙when I was in kindergarten.
00004
The part of the song that ◙says "If you want it...", ◙sounds kind of arrogant. ◙I feel like looking down ◙on someone.
00005
...Are you looking down ◙on a pigeon？
00006
How would you feel if you ◙were a pigeon？ Try to feel ◙like a pigeon.
00007
Feeling like a pigeon, ◙huh... Po... Popopo.
00008
That's just the sound it ◙makes. It's not like that, ◙just try to imagine you're ◙a pigeon.
00009
The feeling of a pigeon's ◙feelings... I'll think ◙about it.
00010
○○○○○○○○
00011
It's about our talk about ◙pigeons from last time.
00012
Manaka
00013
Ah, yes. Did you think ◙about it？
00014
I think it's a problem ◙that involves pigeons, ◙too. They act like "I'm ◙going to do whatever I ◙want", and then they eat ◙whenever.
00015
You mean pigeons are bad？
00016
I was thinking that maybe ◙the pigeons need to change ◙their mindset.
00017
Something like a change ◙of heart for the pigeons？
00018
Like, "you can't eat if ◙you act mighty while ◙flying". I think that kind ◙of attitude is...
00019
But I think if I have ◙something I like in front ◙of me, I will eat it based ◙on my instincts.
00020
If you have something you ◙like in front of you...
00021
What's wrong？ Saying that ◙so suddenly...
00022
Manaka
00023
I was thinking about the ◙song "Hato Poppo", but...
00024
○○○○○○○○
00025
Ah, did you come up with ◙a way to make pigeons ◙change their minds？
00026
Why don't we change the ◙lyrics instead？
00027
Huh, what do you mean？
00028
Something like "How are ◙you？ If you want beans, ◙I'll give some to you♪"
00029
...Hey, I think it's not ◙bad. However, I feel it ◙still doesn't solve the ◙problem.
00030
What do you think if we ◙change the way they see ◙the world？ And we change ◙the composition along ◙the way.
00031
You're right, it may be ◙good to change "I'll give ◙you" to "Can you eat with ◙me？"...
00032
Are you going to eat with ◙the pigeons？
00033
Yes, of course. Not only ◙with pigeons, but also ◙human beings will change ◙their consciousness.
00034
Hehe, will we do it too？
00035
Manaka
00036
I gave the song "Hato ◙Poppo" a thought.
00037
○○○○○○○○
00038
I'm still thinking about ◙it.
00039
I don't think it's because ◙we need to scare ◙pigeon-san away.
00040
"Pigeon-san"？
00041
Yes. So I was thinking ◙about new making lyrics...
00042
Well, I thought about it ◙the other day, but I can't ◙change old masterpieces ◙without permission.
00043
But, think about the ◙feelings of the pigeons... ◙Speaking of which, what ◙do you think about their ◙feelings？
00044
For that... I'm going to ◙ask the pigeon directly.
00045
Can you understand what ◙they say？
00046
I'll listen to them when ◙we go to the park on a ◙date. If there's a pigeon ◙there, then...
00047
Hehe, really？
00048
Manaka
00049
...Hey, what do you do when ◙you can't sleep at night？
00050
○○○○○○○○
00051
I think about you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00052
Take it seriously！
00053
I'm serious, really. ◙I think about you, and ◙then I can fall asleep, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00054
With me？ Can you sleep ◙when you think about me？
00055
Something like that. ◙I don't know what to say, ◙but your memory makes me ◙so happy and mentally calm.
00056
I'm not sure, but if you ◙think about me, and you ◙can sleep. Do you think ◙it'll work for Ako-chan？
00057
Ako-chan？
00058
My cousin. She asked me ◙about what to do with her ◙lack of sleep. Then I'll... ◙I'll tell her that she ◙must think of me.
00059
Wait, wait a second. Don't ◙do that！
00060
Why？
00061
Manaka
00062
Ako-chan still can't sleep ◙well...
00063
○○○○○○○○
00064
That was your cousin, ◙right？
00065
Right. We live a bit apart ◙but we're near the same ◙age.
00066
Huh, I'm sure your cousin ◙is a beautiful woman, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00067
I think she's much more ◙beautiful than me.
00068
That's not true.
00069
...You've never met ◙Ako-chan, right？ I don't ◙think you know her face ◙or her style.
00070
There's no way she's more ◙beautiful than you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00071
...Yes, she is. There are ◙a lot of girls a lot more ◙beautiful than me.
00072
Not here. At least not in ◙my world.
00073
...That must be a strange ◙world.
00074
Manaka
00075
Ako-chan asked for my help ◙again...
00076
○○○○○○○○
00077
Your cousin with insomnia？
00078
It's not insomnia, it's ◙just that she can't sleep ◙that easy... Do you know ◙of something that could ◙help her？
00079
Why doesn't she go to the ◙batting center before ◙going to bed and do some ◙exercise？
00080
She's a girl, so that kind ◙of thing...
00081
Counting up to 50,000 ◙sheep？
00082
I think she has counted ◙enough sheep already...
00083
Having something to eat ◙before sleeping？ That ◙might relax her body and ◙mind.
00084
But eating before going to ◙bed is not good for you.
00085
It's just a light meal... ◙I don't know what else to ◙do.
00086
Hmm...
00087
Manaka
00088
Ako-chan said she could ◙sleep with a lettuce.
00089
○○○○○○○○
00090
Oh, I'm glad to hear it. ◙What, lettuce？ Can you ◙sleep after eating it？ or ◙did you made it up ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00091
Not me, I remembered seeing ◙it in the British rabbit ◙picture book, and it said ◙lettuce could help.
00092
...I don't really ◙understand what you're ◙talking about.
00093
In the picture book, the ◙rabbits always fell asleep ◙after eating lettuce. ◙I remembered that part.
00094
...Is Ako-chan a rabbit？
00095
Hehe, she's human. But ◙maybe I'm the one who's ◙actually a rabbit. When I ◙tried to eat it, I became ◙sleepy...
00096
Really？ I wonder if it ◙would work for me. There ◙are times when I can't ◙sleep.
00097
Maybe you should try after ◙some time. And, you're not ◙a little rabbit. ◙A capybara, maybe？
00098
Me？ A capybara？ Why such ◙a maniac animal... ◙Do I look like that？
00099
Hehe, why are you making ◙that face？ Thank you for ◙taking the hint.
00100
Manaka
00101
What kind of pet would you ◙like to keep？
00102
○○○○○○○○
00103
I can't keep pets in my ◙room...
00104
Then, what if you could ◙keep one？
00105
...Honestly, it would be ◙a goldfish or a turtle. ◙They don't take up that ◙much space and are easy ◙to take care.
00106
For turtles, rabbits are ◙a better company.
00107
"The Rabbit and the ◙turtle". That doesn't sound ◙like a good combination.
00108
Then just a rabbit！ If you ◙want to keep one, rabbits ◙are the best choice, right？
00109
You're talking about ◙"ifs", aren't you？
00110
Manaka
00111
Hey, if you could keep a ◙rabbit, what kind of breed ◙would you like？
00112
○○○○○○○○
00113
Breeds... Are there that ◙many kinds of rabbits？
00114
The Netherlands Dwarf, ◙Lop-ear, Angola...
00115
...The normal one it's ◙fine. The white one that ◙usually appears in fairy ◙tales.
00116
Japanese White.
00117
That's the one, white ◙rabbits are cute.
00118
Say it again.
00119
I don't mind, but why do ◙you want to hear about ◙fairy tales？
00120
Not that one, the other ◙one.
00121
"White rabbits are cute".
00122
Hehe♪ Right？
00123
Huh？
00124
Manaka
00125
Hey, if you could keep a ◙rabbit...
00126
○○○○○○○○
00127
I know the topic comes ◙often, but I can't keep ◙pets in my room.
00128
It may be someday when you ◙can keep one. It doesn't ◙have to be immediately.
00129
Someday...
00130
Won't you like to have ◙pets around the house？
00131
It's not that I don't like ◙them, but the room must ◙be larger.
00132
That'll be fine.
00133
I'm not there during the ◙day, so I won't be able to ◙feed them.
00134
It's okay, I'll be waiting ◙for you to come back.
00135
You're very confident ◙about this.
00136
I'm a rabbit, so it's ◙okay.
00137
○○○○○○○○
00138
As we were saying before, ◙keeping a dog as a pet ◙is not an option either, ◙right？
00139
Manaka
00140
That's no good.
00141
...A cat？
00142
I said a rabbit. I won't ◙listen to any more ◙suggestions.
00143
Well, a rabbit might be ◙okay...
00144
If we'll live together, ◙it has to be a rabbit.
00145
You really like rabbits. ◙But to keep one for myself ◙is just a tall order.
00146
That's not related to this.
00147
Huh？ What do you mean？
00148
I'm talking about who will ◙live with you.
00149
With me？ But I live alone.
00150
Right now, right？ I'm ◙talking about having a ◙family in the future.
00151
Manaka
00152
An emergency patient ◙arrived to my house the ◙other day...
00153
○○○○○○○○
00154
Huh？ Is your house an ◙emergency designated ◙hospital, ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00155
It's not, but it'll be ◙rude to send away the ◙people. He was an Ojisan ◙who was brought to my ◙family.
00156
Why didn't you call for ◙an ambulance？
00157
He said he doesn't like ◙ambulances. Because he ◙thinks he's bothering ◙other people.
00158
But then it might be a ◙little annoying to have ◙him in your house, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00159
It's an important patient, ◙so it's natural for Papa ◙to receive them.
00160
Yeah, that's fine. ◙So, what about the old ◙man？
00161
We went to the emergency ◙center by ambulance. He ◙had something dangerous, ◙but after being received, ◙he was safe.
00162
So he got into an ◙ambulance after all. ◙If he's fine, then it was ◙worth it.
00163
Manaka
00164
The Ojisan who was sick ◙last time was admitted at ◙the university hospital.
00165
○○○○○○○○
00166
I thought he didn't like ◙ambulances.
00167
It was hard to persuade ◙him to get on.
00168
I see, he was stubborn.
00169
And after that, I got a ◙phone call from the ◙hospital to thank me...
00170
I see, he was fine enough ◙to call you.
00171
I wonder if he used the ◙hospital phone. Papa said ◙he couldn't walk because ◙of his symptoms.
00172
I don't think that could ◙stop him, a stubborn ◙person has a strong sense ◙of duty.
00173
I just hope that doesn't ◙make his symptoms worse...
00174
There are a lot of people ◙who can use their phones ◙in the hospital now, ◙maybe he stayed in bed ◙after all？
00175
Do you think the Ojisan ◙can use a cell phone...？
00176
(That's right, some people ◙have difficulties using ◙technology... Like you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.)
00177
Manaka
00178
The ojisan called in to ◙thank me.
00179
○○○○○○○○
00180
Ah, is he still in the ◙hospital？
00181
He can barely walk now, so ◙he'll be leaving the ◙hospital soon.
00182
I see. Why doesn't he stay？
00183
Because Papa doesn't ◙receive any payment, ◙except medical treatment ◙fees.
00184
I see your father is not ◙stubborn. He's a straight ◙person like you, ◙▲MANAKA▲...
00185
Hehe, he is stubborn, ◙indeed.
00186
I see... I think it'll be ◙a lot of trouble if the ◙father of my girlfriend is ◙stubborn.
00187
Really？ Why？
00188
Like when I say "Give me ◙your daughter's hand ◙please" he will say "I'm ◙not going to do it".
00189
...Oh you.
00190
Manaka
00191
The Ojisan told me he will ◙be leaving the hospital ◙soon.
00192
○○○○○○○○
00193
I see, make sure he doesn't ◙forget to bring a thank-you ◙gift to your house ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00194
I'm sure Papa won't take ◙it.
00195
Huh, but why？ I don't ◙understand.
00196
It would be rude to return ◙an item you received as ◙a thank-you.
00197
If you park an ambulance ◙in front of your house, ◙the Ojisan won't get in.
00198
Ambulances can't be used ◙for that purpose.
00199
Then ask your father to ◙dress as an ambulance.
00200
It's impossible... Hehe, ◙Papa as an ambulance？
00201
Yes. You know, with ◙cardboard or something.
00202
Hehe, hehehe. I'm sorry, ◙Papa... That was so funny.
00203
Manaka
00204
Did you know there is a ◙tale about a King with ◙donkey ears.
00205
○○○○○○○○
00206
Yeah, I've heard about it.
00207
Huh, I wonder how you can ◙find you're a donkey with ◙just your ears.
00208
...Yes, with just the ◙ears it's hard to tell ◙whether it's a donkey, ◙a horse or a dog.
00209
If you have pig's ears, ◙you can be found easily.
00210
I'm sorry, but having ◙pig's ears would make me ◙be eaten. I'm sure it ◙would be a strange tale.
00211
Do you eat pig's ears？
00212
Mimigar is an Okinawan ◙food made from pig's ears. ◙I've eaten it before.
00213
So you ate them... But we ◙weren't talking about ◙Okinawa, were we？
00214
I mean, that's a place ◙were you don't see donkey ◙ears as edible. Do you ◙know were we can find a ◙place like that？
00215
I don't think any country ◙eat dokey ear's... ◙I'm sure.
00216
○○○○○○○○
00217
We were talking about the ◙King with donkey ears, ◙right？ It would be easy ◙to understand if it was ◙a rabbit.
00218
Manaka
00219
Yeah, if it jumps around ◙it can't hide it's ears.
00220
I think it would be ◙popular. The Bunny King！ ◙After all, there's a ◙bunny girl next to me.
00221
...What's wrong？ You're ◙staring at me.
00222
I think the rabbit ears ◙would look good on you, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00223
Me...？ A bunny girl next ◙to the king？
00224
I'm sure it would look ◙good on you. Yes, I really ◙think so.
00225
I don't want that... ◙But, I might be consider ◙it if you are the king.
00226
(I think being King would ◙be hard.)
00227
Manaka
00228
Hey, you work part-time, ◙correct？
00229
○○○○○○○○
00230
Huh？ Yeah, I do.
00231
I want to try too. I think ◙I'll give it a try someday.
00232
Why？ Don't you have enough ◙pocket money.
00233
No, that's not why... ◙For my social studies, ◙I guess？
00234
Ah, I see.
00235
And for you...
00236
Me？
00237
I want to learn from you, ◙be it at school, club ◙activities or part-time ◙jobs.
00238
(She's serious about ◙wanting learn from me...)
00239
○○○○○○○○
00240
By the way, what happened ◙to your wish of having a ◙part-time job？
00241
Manaka
00242
Ah, for that... I spoke ◙with Mama and Papa...
00243
Oh, and did they told you？
00244
Papa said "High school ◙students should only focus ◙on their studies and club ◙activities".
00245
I see... But that's fine, ◙isn't it？
00246
Why？
00247
If you work part-time we ◙would spend even less time ◙together or having dates, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00248
I see, but...
00249
No buts, in high school, ◙concentrate on your studies ◙and club activities.
00250
Geez... I get it, Papa.
00251
Manaka
00252
Hey, how do you put ◙backspin into your serve？
00253
○○○○○○○○
00254
I can't do that！
00255
Why？ Rina-senpai said ◙there was a person who was ◙doing it.
00256
Rina-senpai is first ◙ranked in the district... ◙Doesn't she know about ◙serve and backspin？
00257
Do you know how she does ◙it？
00258
If it's an over-serve you ◙can't do a backspin. ◙For that you have to put ◙strength below and hit.
00259
Isn't that a slice？
00260
It's not a slice serve. ◙You do it at this angle... ◙this way...
00261
Without a racket, I can't ◙possibly know how.
00262
That's why it's like this ◙easy to do it like this. ◙Like this！
00263
Are you feeling okay？
00264
Nevermind.
00265
Manaka
00266
Sometimes my backhand and ◙top spin don't come ◙right...
00267
○○○○○○○○
00268
Oh, then it's non-spining. ◙You have a lot of two- ◙handed hits, right ◙▲MANAKA▲？
00269
I'm better at using both ◙hands because I hit it by ◙just rotating my body.
00270
If you lower your racket's ◙head when you hit it back, ◙you'll naturally get a ◙topspin.
00271
It's easier said than ◙done.
00272
It's like this... All you ◙have to do is take it back ◙and return it like this.
00273
I don't have my racket, ◙so I can't make head nor ◙tails of this.
00274
Look at my wrist, pull out ◙like this... Like this！
00275
Are you okay？
00276
I just slipped a little.
00277
Hehe, don't overdo it okay？
00278
Manaka
00279
....
00280
○○○○○○○○
00281
...What's wrong？
00282
No, it's nothing.
00283
...I see.
00284
You are watching me, ◙aren't you？
00285
How can you tell？
00286
I don't hate it, but...
00287
Then it's not troublesome, ◙right？
00288
Huh？
00289
Manaka
00290
....
00291
○○○○○○○○
00292
You're watching me again.
00293
Hehe, I really want to look ◙at you.
00294
Why？ I don't think I'm ◙fun to watch.
00295
No, it's fun, don't you ◙think？
00296
...I don't have fun ◙looking at myself in the ◙mirror.
00297
Do you think that might ◙be a problem？
00298
No, but it might be fun ◙to watch your face instead, ◙▲MANAKA▲.
00299
...I don't have fun ◙looking at myself at the ◙mirror either, you know？
00300
I don't think that's the ◙prob... What？
00301
Hehe, now we're having fun, ◙right？
00302
(Well, this is funny.)
