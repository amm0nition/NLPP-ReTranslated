New Year is coming soon. ◙It's nice to have a ◙boyfriend and visit the ◙shrine.
00002
Manaka
00003
Yes, this is nice. Early ◙in New Year's eve, I'm ◙making memories with my ◙boyfriend.
00004
Manaka
00005
I wish I could go... ◙I wonder if you can take ◙me with you.
00006
Manaka
00007
Valentine's Day is coming ◙soon. What should I do？
00008
Manaka
00009
Of course. I'll prepare a ◙special chocolate just for ◙you. Hehe.
00010
Manaka
00011
I want to give you a ◙special chocolate. I hope ◙it'll make you happy.
00012
Manaka
00013
White Day is coming soon. ◙Now I'm getting worried ◙about it.
00014
Manaka
00015
I'm sure my boyfriend will ◙give me a nice present... ◙I'm kidding.
00016
Manaka
00017
Yes... I think it's ◙probably okay... Did you ◙remember it, boyfriend...？
00018
Manaka
00019
April Fool's Day is coming ◙soon. I wonder if something ◙funny will happen.
00020
Manaka
00021
I wonder about it. If my ◙boyfriend did it, I'm sure ◙the prank may be fun.
00022
Manaka
00023
It's not an event for ◙lovers to celebrate. It's ◙okay, even if there's ◙nothing planned.
00024
Manaka
00025
Golden Week is coming soon. ◙Wonderful things will ◙happen.
00026
Manaka
00027
I'm sure it'll be fun if ◙I'm with you.
00028
Manaka
00029
It'll be nice if you can ◙think of something.
00030
Manaka
00031
The school pool will be ◙opening soon. I wonder ◙what do you think about ◙when you look at me.
00032
Manaka
00033
Eh... It's embarrassing ◙and it leaves me a little ◙worried. I'm kidding.
00034
Manaka
00035
...I wonder what should ◙I do if we're seen by ◙other people.
00036
Manaka
00037
It will be Tanabata soon. ◙A wish made between us... ◙I'm kidding.
00038
Manaka
00039
It would be nice if we can ◙make a wish together...
00040
Manaka
00041
I wonder if you are ◙interested at all.
00042
Manaka
00043
There's going to be a ◙swimsuit contest soon. ◙I wonder what kind of ◙event it is.
00044
Manaka
00045
Dear boyfriend... I wonder ◙if this kind of thing is ◙of any interest to you.
00046
Manaka
00047
I'm sure... I guess I'm ◙going to move a around ◙here.
00048
Manaka
00049
There will be a sports ◙festival soon. I want to ◙see you giving your all.
00050
Manaka
00051
Hehe. If it's you, I'm ◙sure you will do your best.
00052
Manaka
00053
I wonder if you'll take ◙this seriously. I want to ◙make memories with you...
00054
Manaka
00055
Halloween it's around the ◙corner. I wonder if we ◙can do something together.
00056
Manaka
00057
Oh, that's right... ◙I wonder if this will ◙surprise you.
00058
Manaka
00059
I hope you don't think ◙this is too troublesome.
00060
Manaka
00061
There will be a school ◙festival soon. Here's ◙hoping we can have fun ◙together.
00062
Manaka
00063
If I'm with you, I'm sure ◙we can make some happy ◙memories.
00064
Manaka
00065
I want to be with you. ◙I hope you think the same.
00066
Manaka
00067
It's almost Christmas. An ◙important day for lovers.
00068
Manaka
00069
The Eve and, of course, ◙you... All right.
00070
Manaka
00071
I want to spend time with ◙him... Please, God.
00072
Manaka
00073
We are in a "frontal ◙relationship". Do you ◙understand？
00074
Manaka
00075
We are in a relationship ◙"from now on". Do you ◙understand？
00076
Manaka
00077
To tell you the truth, ◙I want to... travel with ◙you. What am I doing！
00078
Manaka
00079
I want to travel with ◙you... That's what I'm ◙thinking.
00080
Manaka
00081
I got sunburned when I ◙went out with you. I got ◙the tan lines of my ◙swimsuit.
00082
Manaka
00083
I went out in a swimsuit, ◙and I'm glad I didn't get ◙sunburned.
00084
Manaka
00085
You're so kind. That's why ◙I love you.
00086
Manaka
00087
You are so cool, and that ◙makes you so nice.
00088
Manaka
00089
You are pretty aggressive, ◙so I think you should take ◙the lead.
00090
Manaka
00091
You are pretty passive ◙sometimes, so I thought ◙I'd better lead.
00092
Manaka
00093
When you say "I can see ◙it better on a big screen". ◙I wonder what that means.
00094
Manaka
00095
"I'd like a bigger screen". ◙What do you mean？
00096
Manaka
00097
Will you come and see me ◙again soon, after you ◙say goodbye？
00098
Manaka
00099
It took a long time to ◙say goodbye, and then you ◙come right back to see me ◙again.
00100
Manaka
00101
Geez, you're talking about ◙it again, right？
00102
Manaka
00103
I'm curious about it. ◙Do you want to know it too？
00104
Manaka
00105
Do you want to speak？ ◙Okay, well then...
00106
Manaka
00107
Did you know about it？ ◙You know...
00108
Manaka
00109
Come to think of it, do you ◙want me to call you now？
00110
Manaka
00111
Oh, I know. Can I call you ◙later？
00112
Manaka
00113
▲PLAYER▲. ◙I wonder if you...
00114
Manaka
00115
▲PLAYER▲, that's...
00116
Manaka
00117
Oh, you have strong hands.
00118
Manaka
00119
It's true, I suppose I call ◙you often by your name.
00120
Manaka
00121
Ah... Hehe, it seems we get ◙along well.
00122
Manaka
00123
Eh？ That's how you want to ◙call me...
00124
Manaka
00125
What kind of name is that？
00126
Manaka
00127
Then, how do you want me ◙to call you？
00128
Manaka
00129
Yes, I want to know.
00130
Manaka
00131
I want to know, please tell ◙me.
00132
Manaka
00133
Huh？ That now sounds ◙really good.
00134
Manaka
00135
Wow, nice.
00136
Manaka
00137
Hmm, I see.
00138
Manaka
00139
Sometimes, there are things ◙like that, too.
00140
Manaka
00141
There's going to be a ◙swimsuit contest soon. ◙I wonder what kind of ◙event it is.
00142
Manaka
00143
Dear... I wonder if you ◙are interested in this ◙kind of thing.
00144
Manaka
00145
I'm sure... I guess I'm ◙going to be moving a lot.
